Genesis 1:17 and god made them in the other side of heaven, so that they were in the earth.

Genesis 1:18 although god saw that it was good, the day, the night and the evening, god saw that it was good.

Genesis 1:19 and it was something, and there was morning, the first day.

Genesis 1:20 then god said, " the waters are in a district of thousand, in each side of the earth, on the other side of heaven. " and it was so.

Genesis 1:21 and god made the earthly lives and all the living creatures that produced the water according to their generations, and all their divisions in each side. and god saw that it was good.

Genesis 2:4 this is the creation of heaven and earth when it happened, when the lord god created heaven and earth,

Genesis 2:5 and all the field as long as it is already on the earth, and all the fields before the wilderness, for god is not toward the earth, and there is no human human countryside.

Genesis 2:6 as long as it is suffering from the earth, it will spend all the face of the earth.

Genesis 2:7 and god will make a human difficult from the earth, and if it is a creature of life in his face, so that the man became a single life.

Genesis 2:8 in the east of the east, the lord god was there, and he put the man there, whom he was.

Genesis 2:9 and the lord, the god, was abandoned from the earth every good and good tree, so that the tree of life was in the middle of the wall.

Genesis 2:10 in the district of the district of the district of the district of the district of the region.

Genesis 2:11 the one of the one is cumin ; this is the one who lives the whole land where the gold is.

Genesis 2:12 the gold of the earth is good. there is the one who is, and there is the year.

Genesis 2:13 the name of the one ' s name was cisrah, who is the child of the whole earth always.

Genesis 2:14 the jeventh of the clothing, that is in the east of assur, and the clothing there is in the inside side.

Genesis 2:15 so god god took the man whom he was, and placed him at the wall of them and in the other side.

Genesis 2:16 then the lord god commanded to the man, saying, " eat every way that is in the east you should eat.

Genesis 2:17 from the district of the wall of you will be good and evil. but on the day when it is something, you will be put to death.

Genesis 2:18 then the lord god said, " it is not right to the man to be just as he is for him.

Genesis 2:19 now all the wild animals of the earth and all the creatures of the sky and brought them to the man to see what they were. and whatever adam called a life, it was his name.

Genesis 2:20 then adam called names to all the earthly people, to all who are in the sky, and to all the inhabitants of the field, but no one was found like him.

Genesis 2:21 and god has made a creature over adam and number, and he took one of his officers and each of the flesh in his place.

Genesis 2:22 then the lord god rebuked a woman that he had married from the man, and brought her to the man.

Genesis 2:23 then adam said, " now she will be a wife from my household and flesh from my flesh, for she will be a wife from her husband.

Genesis 2:24 for this reason a man will give his father and mother, and it is to his wife, and they will become one flesh.

Genesis 2:25 so the two were, both adam and his wife, but they were not toward them.

Genesis 3:1 the one who is in the order of all the creatures of the earth that the lord god has done. " the officer said to it, ' why then has god said, ' there is nothing of what is in the inside. "

Genesis 3:2 then the woman said to him, " on the inside side of the wall.

Genesis 3:3 but from the evening of the clothing, which is in the middle of the year, god says, ' it will not be anything of it, so that it is no longer.

Genesis 3:4 the governor said to it, " you will not be put to death.

Genesis 3:5 for god is just as in the day when it comes from it, your eyes are to you, and you will be as something of good and evil.

Genesis 3:6 when the woman saw that the tree was good for it, and that it was difficult to see, and in the district of the year and in the wall of his wall, he gave it to her husband with her, and he ate.

Genesis 3:7 the eyes of the two were difficult, and they recognized that they were difficult, and thus they were done for themselves.

Genesis 3:8 when they heard the voice of the lord god in the district of the inside side, and the man and his wife was divided from the presence of the lord god in the middle of the year.

Genesis 3:9 then god god called adam and said to him, " where are you ? "

Genesis 3:10 and he said, " i have heard your voice in the inside and on the evening, because i am equal and evening.

Genesis 3:11 and the man said to him, " who is different for you to eat from it, except that it is against you to eat from it ? "

Genesis 3:12 and the man said, " the woman you gave with me, she gave me from the year, and i ate. "

Genesis 3:13 then the lord god said to him, " why did you do this ? " the woman who was about me said, " and i ate. "

Genesis 3:14 then the lord god said to the clothing, " because you have done this something from all the animals and all the creatures of the earth, you will eat because you have done this.

Genesis 3:15 it will be a district among you and the woman, and among your descendants and her descendants. it will be your head, and you will be in order of her. "

Genesis 3:16 on the district of the wall, it says, " however, it will be in the number of two children, and your gift is to your husband, and he will be suffering to you.

Genesis 3:17 and to adam he said, " since it is about your wife ' s voice, so that you should not eat from it, it is the earth. you will eat it as long as you live.

Genesis 3:18 you will give you something, and you will eat the creature of the field.

Genesis 3:19 in the wall of your face you will eat your bread until you are leading into the land, from which you are, because you are a ground and a severe land.

Genesis 3:20 and adam called his wife named eva, because she was mother of all his husbands.

Genesis 3:21 so the lord god made to adam and to his beyond it, in the district of it, and sitting them.

Genesis 3:22 then the lord god said, " look, a man of us, the one of us, is good and evil. now if it is not to think his hand and take the sacrifice of life and eat and always. "

Genesis 3:23 so the lord god sent him out from the district of the wall, the land from which it was.

Genesis 3:24 so he watched the man and the district of them, in the east of the district of the wall, the wall of the clothing, the way to the way of life.

Genesis 4:1 now adam knew for his wife, and eheh became the father of cain, and he said for a one man through the lord.

Genesis 4:2 and in number of his brothers, abel, he became a sheep of sheep, but cain was in the inside of the land.

Genesis 4:3 after some days cain brought sacrifice to the lord from the fruit of the earth.

Genesis 4:4 and abel offered his sheep and his sheep, and god was revealed to abel and his household.

Genesis 4:5 but in cain and his household it is not difficult. cain was toward cain, and it was something something.

Genesis 4:6 then the lord said to cain, " why are you difficult ? why can you think your face ?

Genesis 4:7 if it is toward you, if it will be difficult with you, you will be with you, and you will be with him.

Genesis 4:8 then cain said to his brother abel to the other side. when they were in the inside, cain stood up to his brother abel and to them.

Genesis 4:9 then god said to cain, " where is your brother abel ? " he replied, " no, i am not beyond my brother. "

Genesis 4:10 then god said, " what did you done ? the voice of the blood of your brother calls out to me from the earth.

Genesis 4:11 and now, if you are different from the earth where her mouth is like the blood of your brother from your hand,

Genesis 4:12 when you work the earth, it is not toward it, to give you something, and you will be possessed on the earth. "

Genesis 4:13 then cain said to the lord, " just is my household that is about me.

Genesis 4:14 if i beyond me today from the ground of the earth, i will be suffering from your presence, and i will be in high and evening on the earth, and every one who is in me will be about me.

Genesis 4:15 then the lord said to him, " for this reason, every one who is in cain, will be for seven thousand. " so the lord made a sign to cain so that nothing of them was about him.

Genesis 4:16 so cain went out from the presence of god, and in the country of the wilderly country, cain, cain.

Genesis 4:17 cain knew his wife, and hosa became the father of hosa, and in each of the towns, and in the wall of the city, according to his son ' s name.

Genesis 7:21 then all human humanity died in the town, the beast, the clothing, and all the creature on the earth, and all humanity.

Genesis 7:22 all that had something of life, everything that was on the household, died.

Genesis 7:23 then all the creature that was on the round of the earth, from people to divisions, in the district of the heavens, and came from the earth. so noah and his companions were in the wilderness.

Genesis 7:24 and the water in the earth was about hundred and fifty days.

Genesis 8:1 and the god of noah, all his household, all the birds, all his household, and all the things that were with him in the wilderness. and god made a spirit over the earth, and the water was over.

Genesis 8:2 as long as the wall of the wall and the inside of the sky will be different, so that it is coming from heaven.

Genesis 8:3 in the beginning of a hundred and fifty days the water was divided from the ground.

Genesis 8:4 on the jeventh month, on the first day of the month, he sat down on the large mountain.

Genesis 8:5 the water was divided. in the next month, on the first day of the month, was in the wall of the mountains.

Genesis 8:6 after firty days there was, when noah was ahead of the wall he had done,

Genesis 8:7 so he sent a seed to see if the water was suffering, and it was not always, until the water came from the ground.

Genesis 8:8 he sent the crowd after him to see if the water were suffering from the face of the earth.

Genesis 8:9 and because water is on the entier of the earth, it was not toward him in the ark, because water was on the entire region. so he threw his hand and threw it up to himself in the ark.

Genesis 8:10 after seven days there was, he sent the scroll again from the wall.

Genesis 8:11 in the district of the district of the district of the wall, was in his mouth. so noah realized that the water was suffering from the ground.

Genesis 8:12 now after seven days there was again, he sent the wall again, but did not be revealed to him again.

Genesis 8:13 on the eventh years of noah, on the first month, on the first day of the month, the water came from the earth, and while she saw that the water was suffering from the ground of the earth.

Genesis 8:14 on the jeventh month, on the first day of the month, there is the earth.

Genesis 8:15 then god said to noah,

Genesis 8:16 " go out of the camp, you and your wife, your sons and your sons ' children with you.

Genesis 8:17 and all the animals that are with you, and every flesh from the wild, to the beast, and all the creatures that are on the earth.

Genesis 8:18 so noe went out with his sons, his wife, his sons, and the women of his sons with him.

Genesis 8:19 all the birds, all the beast, all the moundation, everything that is on the earth, according to their divisions, is inside from the wall.

Genesis 8:20 so noah built a altar to the lord. he took from all the district of the wild animals, from all the clothing of it, and a district of them on the altar.

Genesis 8:21 now in the direction, the lord god is in the sever. and the lord said, " there is no longer to spend the earth because of man ' s work, because the direction of man is toward what is evil from the wall. so just as i have done, it will be just as i have done.

Genesis 8:22 always, as long as the earth is, seed and district, and seventy, and seventy, day and night, it is no longer.

Genesis 9:1 and god blessed noah and his sons and said to them :

Genesis 9:4 nevertheless, it is not experienced in it.

Genesis 9:5 even if the blood of your husbands is different, from the hand of all that are in it, and from the hand of a person ' s brother will leave the human life.

Genesis 9:6 the person who produces human blood is in the place of his blood, because in the devotion of god he has made the man.

Genesis 9:7 but you, in the eventy and district, it is the earth, and you live on it.

Genesis 9:8 then god said to noah and to his sons with him, saying,

Genesis 9:9 " for this reason i am trying my covenant with you and with your companity after you,

Genesis 9:10 and with every person who is with you, from the wall, from the beast, and from all the inhabitants of the earth, which is with you, from the wall of the wall.

Genesis 9:11 i will accomplish my covenant with you, and all human creatures will not be again from the water of sea, and there will no longer be water over all the earth.

Genesis 9:12 then the lord said to noe, " this is the sign of the covenant that i make among me and you, and every soul that is with you, in generations for generations.

Genesis 9:13 the guard of me will be in the cloud, and it will be a sign of the covenant among me and the earth.

Genesis 9:14 and when it is in the mountain, as i am in the cloud, it will not be much on the ground.

Genesis 9:15 now in the jewish covenant of my covenant, which is among me and you, and every soul that is in every human nature, the water will not be ever.

Genesis 9:16 it will be in the cloud and in the direction of the sanctuary, it will be a eternal covenant among me and every soul in every body that is on the earth. "

Genesis 9:17 then god said to noe, " this is the sign of the covenant that is among me and all the flesh that is on the earth. "

Genesis 9:18 now the sons of noah, who were in the region of sem, were as the father of canaan.

Genesis 9:19 these three were the sons of noah, suffering over all the earth.

Genesis 9:20 and noah began to be difficult and difficult.

Genesis 9:21 and just as he was in his house, he was different of the wine, it is in his house.

Genesis 9:23 however, shem, and district of the clothing in their two household, and followed the wall of their father. their face was districted, but did not see the devotion of their father.

Genesis 9:24 when noah came from his wine, he realized what his first son had done with him.

Genesis 9:25 so he said, " canaan, he will be a servant of his household. "

Genesis 9:26 and he said, " praise the lord god of sem, and canaan will be his servant.

Genesis 9:27 god is in the number of the district, in the district of sem, and in the region of canaan their servant.

Genesis 9:28 so noah was four and five years with the authorities.

Genesis 15:2 abram said, " what can you give me ? i will be suffering, and the son of my company is eliezer. "

Genesis 15:3 abram replied, " because you have not given a descendant to me, but my confidence reject me.

Genesis 15:4 then the voice of the lord came to him : " this is not like you, but is the one who comes out of you. "

Genesis 16:6 then abram said to her, " look, your moundation is in your hand for her, just as you are for you. "

Genesis 16:7 the angel of the lord found her on the water of the water in the wilderness, on the wall that is on the road of shur.

Genesis 16:8 the angel of the lord said to her, " from where it is, and where is it ? " she replied, " i am from the presence of my way. "

Genesis 16:9 the angel of the lord said to her, " it is toward your tail, and it is under her hand. "

Genesis 16:10 the angel of the lord said to her, " it will be like your descendants, so that it will not be from it. "

Genesis 16:12 he will be a man like a man, his hand will be against all of them, and the hand of all against him, and in the presence of all his brothers.

Genesis 16:13 then he called the name of the lord, the high god, to her : " you are the god who lives me. " for she said, " even before i saw that it is for me ? "

Genesis 16:14 for this reason he called the mountain, " it is not to see. look, there is among cades and aaron.

Genesis 16:15 she gave a son to abram, and abram called his son whom ishmael had given to him.

Genesis 16:16 abram was for sex years years when she became birth to abram.

Genesis 17:2 so you will make my covenant among me and you, and you will be imprisoned.

Genesis 17:3 so abram fell down with his face to the ground, and god spoke to him :

Genesis 17:4 and i, look, my household with you, and you will be a father of all nations.

Genesis 17:5 and you will never name abram again, but your name will be abraham, because you will have a father of many nations.

Genesis 17:6 you will be experienced greatly, and you will become nations, and every kingdom will be different from you.

Genesis 17:7 he will make my covenant among me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, as a eternal covenant, that i will be your god and your descendants after you.

Genesis 17:8 i will give you the earth in the region of the entire region of canaan, for eternal generations, and i will be their god. "

Genesis 17:9 then god said to abraham, " you also are my covenant like you and your descendants after you in their generations.

Genesis 17:10 this is the direction that will be inside you and you and your descendants after you, in their generations, in all generations.

Genesis 17:11 so you will make your earthly flesh, and it will be in the way of a covenant among me and you.

Genesis 17:12 it must be a child of eight days for you, in your generations, the household of your house, and the one who is a child of any child, who is not from your descendants.

Genesis 17:13 the governor of your house and your year will be suffering, and it will be in your flesh as a eternal covenant.

Genesis 17:14 and whenever it does not spend his own flesh on the earthly day, that person is from it, because it is according to my covenant.

Genesis 17:15 and god said to abraham, " your wife saraah, whose name is sarah, but its name will be a year.

Genesis 17:16 i will leave it and give you a child from it, and it will become nations, and the kings of the nations will come from it.

Genesis 17:17 then abraham fell down with his face to his face and lifted down with his face to the ground and said, " if it is seventy or seventy years, is there ? "

Genesis 17:18 so abraham said to god, " ismael is in your presence ! "

Genesis 17:19 and god said, " yes, your wife is with you a son, whom you is named isaac. he will accomplish my covenant with him, as a eternal covenant with his household after him.

Genesis 17:20 now about ishmael, look, it is with you. look, they are ahead of them, and wall of them is a number of twelve nations, and i will make him a great nation.

Genesis 17:21 but my covenant with isaac, which you will be toward the year of this time, in the year of the year.

Genesis 17:22 when god was suffering to him, god went up from abraham.

Genesis 17:23 so abraham took his son ishmael, his son, and all his household, and all who were in his household, and all the people of abraham ' s house, in the same day, just as god had spoken to him.

Genesis 17:24 abraham was a longer of thousand years when he divided his own flesh.

Genesis 17:25 his son ismael was three and three years when he loved his own flesh.

Genesis 17:26 at that day abraham and his son ismael was in the affection of the day.

Genesis 17:27 and all the people of his house, his household, and those who are in his household, will be given to them from the number of the gentiles.

Genesis 18:1 to the door of his wall, at the door of his tabernacle, god happened to him at the door of his tabernacle.

Genesis 18:2 when he looked, he saw three men by him. when he saw them from the door of his tabernacle, he saw three men by him. when he saw them from the door of his tent, he fell to the ground.

Genesis 18:3 and said, " lord, if i have found grace in your eyes, do not leave your companions.

Genesis 18:4 however, there is water, and inside your feet, and it was in the side of the wall.

Genesis 18:5 instead, something for bread and year, you will accomplete your way. " they replied, " it is just as it is. "

Genesis 18:6 when abraham appeared to the tabernacle to the wall, he said to her, " it is seventy, thousand, thousand, and thousand.

Genesis 18:7 so he went to the backs of abraham, which was in abraham. he took it good and good, and gave it to the year and his district, to make it.

Genesis 18:8 so he took clock, mleck, and sheep that he had done, and it was to them, while he was in the side of the district of the wall.

Genesis 18:9 so they asked him, " where is your wife ? " he replied, " he is in the tent. "

Genesis 18:10 he said, " i will come to you at this time for a time, and your wife will have a son of her. " now he heard about the wall of the tabernacle that was in his wall.

Genesis 18:11 and abraham and all the elders who were already although they were already elders,

Genesis 18:12 as long as it is in the district of the region, i have something something for me until now, but my lord is something.

Genesis 18:13 then the lord said to abraham, " why

Genesis 18:14 " may a message be done for the lord. in this time for this time i will come to you at this time, and it will be a son of it.

Genesis 18:15 if it is difficult, it is not suffering. " he said, " no, " he said.

Genesis 18:16 as long as the men ' s husbands were from there, he was on the district of the district, but abraham was with them.

Genesis 18:17 but the lord said, " should i be from abraham, my defense that i am for you ?

Genesis 18:18 abraham will become a great nation, a great nation, and all the nations of the earth will be in it.

Genesis 18:19 for it is in the way that the lord will accomplite abraham and his people after him, and in all the way of the lord, to do what is right and right, so that the lord may accomplite abraham what he has spoken to him. "

Genesis 18:20 then the lord said, " in the number of two and thousand, and their cloaks will be complete.

Genesis 18:21 as much, you think to me something according to their experience. but if not, it should be done.

Genesis 18:22 the men went from there and went to sodom, but abraham was right before the lord.

Genesis 18:23 and abraham said, " is it not just as a righteous one with them, so that the righteous will be like the one.

Genesis 18:24 if they are fifty years in the city, it is not toward all the place because of the fifty righteous ones who are in it.

Genesis 18:25 " in the same way, you will perform like this : it is just as the righteous one who lives the whole earth will not execute judgment.

Genesis 18:26 then the lord said, " if i find about fifty years in the city for all the place because of them,

Genesis 18:27 abraham answered, " now i am in order with my lord, though i am a earth and something.

Genesis 18:28 if the fifty thousand, for the five, it will be all the city. " but he said, " indeed, if i find there fifty and five. "

Genesis 18:29 while he was still suffering to him, he said, " if there is four people there, " he said, " i will not be for the sake of the firty. "

Genesis 18:30 but he said, " do not take nothing, my lord, if it is, or if it is thirty there, " he replied, " no longer if i find thirty there, no longer. "

Genesis 18:31 he replied, " i have a suffering to the lord. if there is twenty, " he replied, " i will not be because of the twenty-two. "

Genesis 18:32 and he said, " do not be done again. if it is there ten, he said, " i will not be for the sake of the ten. "

Genesis 18:33 so the lord went away as a scroll for abraham and abraham in his place.

Genesis 19:1 so the two went to sodom to the evening at the evening, and lot was ahead of the wall. when lot saw them, it was a district of them to the ground.

Genesis 19:2 and he said, " look, there is a different measure in the household of your district, as long as it is. " but they said, " no, instead, in the wilderness. "

Genesis 19:3 so he gathered them, and they gathered to him. when he entered his house, he made a district for them, and so they were eating.

Genesis 19:4 before the evening, the people of the city, who were in the inside of the house, were from the east to the district of the house.

Genesis 19:5 they gathered lot and said to him, " where are the men who is in the night with you at the night, so that we may be to them. "

Genesis 19:6 so lot went out to them to the wall, and the door was after him.

Genesis 19:7 so he said to them, " not, brothers and sisters, do not happen.

Genesis 19:8 " now i have two daughters that have not known a husband

Genesis 19:9 so they said, " it is there in a district of district, so that you should be experienced judgment. but now you are greater than something. but when lot ' s man was toward lot, he was in district of the door.

Genesis 19:12 then the men said to lot, " you have there anyone there ? there is a son or your sons or your daughters or anyone you have in this city from this place,

Genesis 19:13 for whenever we are this place, because their direction is great in the presence of the lord, and the lord has sent us by it.

Genesis 19:14 so lot went out and spoke to his officers, the two of his daughters, and said, " there is two and seventy from this place, because the lord is distributed the city, but it is in the presence of his household.

Genesis 19:15 when those who spend lot likewise, they said, " get up and take your wife and your two daughters that are in the city, so that it will not come in the wall of the city. "

Genesis 19:16 as well as it is against his lord and his two daughters, which is with his hand, his wife, his wife, and his two daughters.

Genesis 19:17 when they were leaving them outside, they said, " likewise, it is different, not to follow, or stand not in the entire region in the mountain, although it is no longer.

Genesis 19:18 so lot said to them, " no, lord !

Genesis 19:19 because your servant has found mercy in your eyes and reject your righteousness that is against me to live my life, but i will not sure the mountain on the mountain, for no longer there is evil or evening.

Genesis 19:20 look, this city is near the wall, where there is, where there is

Genesis 19:21 so he said to him, " look, your face is like this, so that you will not experience the city where you are.

Genesis 19:22 as long as it is there, it is there, for there is nothing to make anything until you live there. " therefore the city was named horma.

Genesis 19:23 the sun came to the ground while lot came to the wall.

Genesis 19:24 and the lord was over sodom and gomorrah toward sodom, and fire from the lord came from heaven.

Genesis 19:25 and in all these towns, all the region, all the inhabitants of the towns, and all the possessions of the earth.

Genesis 19:26 so his wife stopped back, and she became a clock of salf.

Genesis 19:27 after abraham was morning, abraham went to the place where he was before the lord.

Genesis 19:28 then he stood on the district of the year and district, and on the entire region of the region, he saw, and look, on the district of the earth like a number of thousand.

Genesis 19:29 in the direction of the lord all the towns of the region, the god of abraham, he sent lot from the middle of the wall, in the district of the lord, the towns where lot lived.

Genesis 19:30 so lot went up on the mountain with his two daughters on the mountain in the mountain, he and his two daughters together.

Genesis 19:31 the clothing said to the clothing, " our father is suffering, and there is no one on the earth to come to us like the creation of all the earth.

Genesis 19:32 come and give our father wine, and he will be with him, and he has a descendant from our father.

Genesis 19:33 now at that very night she threw their father of wine. that very night or something was during her father in that night, it will no longer be something.

Genesis 19:34 the next day the guard said to the clothing, " look, it is in high way with our father. this very night he will give them wine, so that it will be with him, and if they have a descendant from our father,

Genesis 19:35 just as it is in the same day, they could also give their father to wine, or in it, or it was divided with her father, so there is nothing in it and in it.

Genesis 19:36 so there were the two daughters of lot from their father.

Genesis 19:37 and she gave birth to a son, whom he named moab from my father. he is the father of them until this day.

Genesis 19:38 the same child also gave a son, whom he named benah. he is the father of the wilders until this day.

Genesis 20:1 so abraham went on from there to the region of the wall and the year, among cades and shur, in the district of the wall.

Genesis 20:2 so abraham said to his wife, " she is my sister. "

Genesis 20:3 so god came to abimelech in the night in the night, and said, " look, you are about the woman that she is for her, for she is a husband. "

Genesis 20:4 but abimelech was not by her. he said, " lord, it is a good and righteous nation.

Genesis 20:5 did he not say to me, ' she is my sister ? ' and she did not say, ' he is my brother. ' i have done this in your heart and righteous hands. "

Genesis 20:6 and god said to him in the insult, " and i, because you have done this in your heart, and if i have done this, i will not put you down to me. for this reason you will not be over you.

Genesis 20:7 now it is already a woman for the husband because he is a prophet. it is a prophet for you. if she does not bear it, you will go to death, you and everything you have.

Genesis 20:8 when abimelech was ahead of morning, he called all his officers and spoke all these words to their ears, but the people were along.

Genesis 20:9 then abimelech called abraham and said to him, " what is this that you have done for us ? why do you think that it is against me and my kingdom for a great sin ? it is a work that no one will be done for me. "

Genesis 20:10 so abimelech said to abraham, " what has you done that you have done ? "

Genesis 20:11 abraham replied, " for i said, " there is nothing in this place for me for my wife.

Genesis 20:12 he is really my sister, a son of my father, but not the son of my mother. so she became my wife.

Genesis 20:13 when god had brought me out of my father ' s house, i said to her, ' take me this right for me : in every place where it is, tell me that he is my brother. ' "

Genesis 20:14 so abimelech took two sheep of sheep, thousand, high, and diven, and gave them to abraham, and he gave him to his wife.

Genesis 20:15 and abimelech said, " look, my land is before you, where you will give you. "

Genesis 20:16 on the next day he says, " look, i will give it something for you. these will be for you in the mountain of your face for all who are with you.

Genesis 20:17 so abraham was in the presence of god, and god was given to abimelech, his wife, his devotion, and all his divisions.

Genesis 20:18 for for the sake of abraham ' s husband, the lord will be experienced in the house of abimelech because of abraham ' s wife.

Genesis 21:1 and the lord was suffering to the way that he promised, and he did what he had promised.

Genesis 21:2 thus she gave birth to abraham a son in the inside side, in the time that god had promised him.

Genesis 21:3 abraham called his son, who was given to him, the name of the son whom isaac had given to him.

Genesis 21:4 at the next day abraham brought isaac, just as god had commanded him.

Genesis 21:5 abraham was about hundred years when isaac was given to him.

Genesis 21:6 and he said, " god has done me : whatever is about me, god has done me. "

Genesis 21:7 and he said, " who is suffering to abraham, since it is difficult child, since i have a son in my mountain.

Genesis 21:8 now the child was evening and evening. so abraham did a great household on the day isaac, his son, was.

Genesis 21:9 in the number of the descendants of the district of the camp who had given to abraham, he was with isaac, her son,

Genesis 21:10 then she said to abraham, " it is toward abraham and her son, for the son of this household is not with my son isaac. "

Genesis 21:11 this saying was very great in the presence of abraham because of his son.

Genesis 21:12 but god said to abraham, " let it not be, if it is in your eyes, or about this, or about it. whatever he says to you, it must be suffering by it, because in isaac he will give you descendant.

Genesis 21:13 and i will make it ' s son to a great nation, because he is your descendants. "

Genesis 21:14 when the abraham got up the morning at the morning, he took bread and wash water and gave it to his home, with the child and sent her, so that it was in the district of the wilderness.

Genesis 21:15 when the water came from the wall, the child was under one of them.

Genesis 21:16 saying : " i will not see the mortal of my direction before him, because she said, " i will not see the mortal of my district. " so she sat down before him, but the child was evening.

Genesis 21:17 and god is in the same way from the place where he was, and the angel of god called the appearing from heaven and said to her, " what is it ? do not be afraid, for god is going to the voice of your guard from the place where he is. "

Genesis 21:18 leave the child, and it is with your hand, for i will make him a great nation. "

Genesis 21:19 and god revealed her eyes, and when she saw much water, she went and gathered the waterless water, and it was the child.

Genesis 21:20 in the wilderness, in the wilderness, and in the wilderness, in the wilderness, and he became something.

Genesis 21:21 now when he was in the wilderness, his mother took him a wife from the land of egypt.

Genesis 21:22 at that time abimelech said, " it is with his companions, and the order of his power said to abraham, " god is with you in everything he is. "

Genesis 21:23 now now it is to me for god : do not bear me or my descendants or my name, but hold to me according to the righteousness that i have done with you, you will accomplish me and the land you live. "

Genesis 21:24 and abraham said, " i am first.

Genesis 21:25 so abraham beared abimelech about the water of the water that the servants of abimelech had gathered.

Genesis 21:26 but abimelech said to him, " no one has done this ? you would not be with me, nor i have heard except this day. "

Genesis 21:27 so abraham took sheep and foolish sheep and gave it to abimelech, and he made a covenant.

Genesis 21:28 so abraham reparted seven bears and two sheep.

Genesis 21:29 so abimelech said to abraham, " what are these seven thousand of these sheep that are in his household ? "

Genesis 21:30 he replied, " you will take these seven thousand from me, so that they will be my eagerly, because i am the something of this.

Genesis 21:31 for this reason the name of that place is horeba, because there is something of something.

Genesis 21:32 ( now there was a covenant in the district of the wall. so abimelech stood up with his household, so that the moundation of his power is revealed, and it will come to the governing land.

Genesis 21:33 now abraham was toward the other side of the wall, where the name of the lord, the holy god, was there.

Genesis 21:34 so abraham was four days in the land of the two days.

Genesis 22:1 after these things god created abraham, and he said to him, abraham ! " he replied, " here i am ! "

Genesis 22:2 and said, " take your son, your officering son, isaac, and go to the wilderly land, where there is there, in one of the mountains that you will give you. "

Genesis 22:3 the morning on the morning abraham got up with his eselin and was with him two divisions, and isaac his son. so he got up and went to the place where god had said to him.

Genesis 22:4 the eventh day abraham looked up and saw the place where he was.

Genesis 22:5 abraham said to his fellow countrymen : " as for him, i and the child am still with you, and i will be with you. "

Genesis 22:6 so abraham took the tree of gath and his son isaac, and he took the fire and the sword in his hand, and they went together.

Genesis 22:7 so isaac said to his father abraham, " he is a father. " but abraham said, " look, my son ! " and he said, " look, here is the fire and the tree. where is the wild sheep ? "

Genesis 22:8 abraham said, " god is imported for himself a sheep for his child, and to them will be something together.

Genesis 22:9 when they came to the place god had told him, abraham bought a altar and the clothing of the trees, and threw his son isaac in their behalf on the altar over the trees.

Genesis 22:10 so abraham threw his hand and gathered the sword for his son.

Genesis 22:11 but the angel of the lord called him from heaven and said, " abraham, abraham ! " he replied, " here i am ! "

Genesis 22:12 so he said, " do not get your hand on the child, and do nothing with him, for it is now already that you are suffering to god, and you are not by your year son because of me. "

Genesis 22:13 when abraham looked up, he saw that in the district of the district of the wall, abraham went and took the back, and it was in the place of his son in the place of his son.

Genesis 22:14 so abraham called that place : " the lord is seen, so that this day the lord is today in the mountain.

Genesis 22:15 then the angel of the lord called abraham a second time from heaven,

Genesis 22:16 " directly, " says the lord. you did not be just as you have done this, and not by your year son because of me.

Genesis 22:17 it will be different to you, so that your descendants will be like the gifts of the sky and like the sand that is on the other side of the sea, and your descendants will give the devoted towns.

Genesis 22:18 all the nations of the earth will be in your powers, because you are in the way of your voice.

Genesis 22:19 when abraham was in the way with his officers, they went to the other side, and the district of abraham was on the other side of the wall.

Genesis 22:20 after these things he happened to abraham, saying, " look, she is a number of thousand, and she is a child for the clothes of you.

Genesis 22:21 his ancestors, his other brothers, and his father, his father,

Genesis 22:22 the hovier, the cumin, the cetheth, the cetheth, the carah,

Genesis 22:23 ehub became the father of jeventh. these were the sons who baared to the sure of abraham.

Genesis 22:24 his creature, the name of gath, was born, and she also was born. she also was born.

Genesis 23:1 the life was two hundred and twenty-seven years.

Genesis 23:2 so abraham died in kiriat-arba ( that is hebron ) in the land of canaan.

Genesis 23:3 then abraham stood up from his tent and said to the sons of heth, saying,

Genesis 23:4 in the same way i am with you. give me in order with you, so that in the day of my dead will be with you.

Genesis 23:5 then the sons of heth said to abraham,

Genesis 23:6 insult us, our lord ! you are a king of god among us, in our household in the direction of your dead. no one of us will be difficulty from you for the one of your dead. "

Genesis 23:7 so abraham stood up to the people of the land to the sons of heth.

Genesis 23:8 and abraham said to them, " if you think that in my presence is about my dead, listen to me, and you think about me for him, son of zohar,

Genesis 23:9 in the district of his district, that is in the district of his field, it will be for me for a district of money in the middle of you.

Genesis 23:10 among the descendants of heth, which was in the middle of the sons of heth, answered abraham, " in the number of the descendants of heth and of all his officials in the city of his city :

Genesis 23:11 " by me, my lord, i will give the field and the creature that is in it. in the presence of all my gifts i will give you in the middle of your dead.

Genesis 23:12 so abraham appeared before the people of the earth.

Genesis 23:13 then he said to the governor, " in the presence of the people of the land, saying, " if it is to me, i will take the money of the field. take it from me and before my dead there. "

Genesis 23:14 then john said to abraham,

Genesis 23:15 lord, what is this among me and you ? what is this among me and you ? in fact, you will have your dead there. "

Genesis 23:16 now abraham heard it, and abraham and abraham was the money that he had proclaimed to the sons of heth in the presence of the sons of heth.

Genesis 23:17 then the district of the district of the clothing, that is in the district of the wall, that is inside of the wall, and as well as everything that is on the field.

Genesis 23:18 he was in the city of abraham in the presence of the people of heth and all his possessions in the city.

Genesis 23:19 after these things, in the journey of abraham, abraham was with his wife in the inside of the wilderly country, that is hebron, in the land of canaan.

Genesis 23:20 of the sons of heth, the year and the district that is in it is to abraham as a district for abraham from the sons of heth.

Genesis 24:1 abraham was about forty days, and the lord blessed abraham in all things.

Genesis 24:2 then abraham said to his servant, the governor of his house, the way of all his possessions : " put your hand under my household,

Genesis 24:3 and you will make you to the lord, the god of heaven, and the god of the earth, so that you will not be a wife for my son of the daughters i live among them.

Genesis 24:4 but you will not be in my country and in my household, and you will take a wife for my son isaac.

Genesis 24:5 the slave said to him, " if the woman would not be with me in this land according to your sons, to the land where you have been. "

Genesis 24:6 abraham said to him, " let it not be with my son there ! "

Genesis 24:7 " the lord, the god of heaven, who took me from my father ' s house and from the land that he spoke to me and spoke to me, saying, ' i will give this land and your foundation. he himself will be with his angels before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.

Genesis 24:8 if the woman does not be with you in this land, you will be toward this way. only my son will not be there. "

Genesis 24:9 then the slave put his hand under his lord abraham ' s service, and swore to him about this way.

Genesis 24:10 so the slave took two thousand of the gifts of his master, and went up, and was with him from all the good things of his master. so he got up and went to the town in the town of the city.

Genesis 24:11 and in the district of the inside of the city, on the west side of the water, in the district of the wall.

Genesis 24:12 and said, " lord, god of my lord abraham, is today before me and doing mercy to my lord abraham.

Genesis 24:13 look, i am seated on the wall of the water, but the daughters of the people in the city are districted with water.

Genesis 24:14 and the something i will experience your household, so that i will drink. and if he says, ' drink, and it will be with your wells, isaac, and in this reason, because you have shown mercy to my lord.

Genesis 24:15 as they were evening in the wall, in the district of the wall, in the district of the district of his wife, the son of the son of abraham.

Genesis 24:16 now the clothing was greatly healthy, since a man did not understand it, but was on the year of the wall, and he went up.

Genesis 24:17 when the slave came to him, he said, " do not be a little water from your mountain !

Genesis 24:18 she replied, " drink, my lord,

Genesis 24:19 until it was divided, he said to your household always, until they find all these things.

Genesis 24:20 in the district of the clothing, in the district of the other side, to the district of the other side and on all his regions.

Genesis 24:21 if the man lives it in the district of the year, whether the lord bears his way or not. "

Genesis 24:22 now when all the gifts of the gifts were completed, the man took them in each side, in each side of each side, and two.

Genesis 24:23 and he said to her, " whose daughter is you ? if there is a place in the house of your father ?

Genesis 24:24 she said to him, " i am a daughter of hosa, who has given to jah.

Genesis 24:25 so he said to him, " we have there a large clothing with us, and there is a place for the year.

Genesis 24:26 the man is suffering for the lord.

Genesis 24:27 and said, " just is the lord, the god of my lord abraham, who does not reject his righteousness and truth from my lord, the lord is to me in the house of my lord ' s brothers. "

Genesis 24:28 then the slave of her mother was in his mother ' s house.

Genesis 24:29 now there was a brother by whom was laban ' s name, and laban was with laban to the man outside, to the wall.

Genesis 24:30 when he saw the clothing of the clothing and the clothing on his clothing, and when he heard what he had done, this man was with me. so he came to his man, on the district on the wall.

Genesis 24:31 so he said to him, " come in the way of the lord, for what is it going outside ? i will be in the house and a place for the household.

Genesis 24:32 so the man went into the house, and in the district of the household, he gave it to it and to the other women, and water in the feet of him and the feet of the men who were with him.

Genesis 24:33 and if they were given to them to eat, he said, " it will not be until i speak my message. " so he said, " speak. "

Genesis 24:34 so he said, " i am the servant of abraham.

Genesis 24:35 " now the lord has greatly blessed my lord, and he has given him sheep and silver, silver, silver, clothing, and inside.

Genesis 24:36 the wife of my lord has given a son to my lord after their number, and he gave him everything he possess.

Genesis 24:37 my lord will bear me and say, ' you must not take a wife for my son from the daughters that i live in their land.

Genesis 24:38 but it must be in my father ' s house and in my household, and you will take a wife for my son. '

Genesis 24:39 so i asked my lord, ' if the woman does not marry with me,

Genesis 24:40 and he said to me, " the lord, who is in his presence, is with you with his angel and in every way your way, and you will take a wife for my son from my tribe and from my father ' s house.

Genesis 24:41 then you will be suffering from my influence, if it is in my household, and if they does not give it to you, you will be ahead of me.

Genesis 24:42 now i came to the year and said, ' lord, god of my lord abraham, if you are according to my way where i live,

Genesis 24:43 look, i will stand on the wall of the water, and the daughter of the people of the city will be districted with water, so that it will be for a little water from your wall.

Genesis 24:44 and she says to me, drink you, and too to your descendants, ' this is the woman in which the lord is in the number of isaac, and in this way, because it is generous mercy to my lord abraham.

Genesis 24:45 instead, before it was in the year, it was in the district of the district of the clothing, he went down on the district of the wall. then i said to her, " inside me. "

Genesis 24:46 however, it will spend the wall of it from the wall. then he said, drink, and the district of the household of you will be different.

Genesis 24:47 " whose daughter are you ? " and i said, " whose daughter is you ? i am a daughter of the son of gath, whom she has born.

Genesis 24:48 i will be suffering to the lord and make the lord, the god of my lord abraham, who is much to me on the way of the truth, with the daughter of the brother of my lord for his son.

Genesis 24:49 if you, my lord, is a different mercy and righteousness for my lord, if it is no longer, i may be suffering to it, whether it is in it.

Genesis 24:50 then laban said to the other, " this sign has come from the lord, and no wrong will be done for you.

Genesis 24:51 look, he is right in your presence. he must be a wife for the son of your lord, just as the lord promised.

Genesis 24:52 now in the evening of the offering of abraham, this district, he was toward the earth to the lord.

Genesis 24:53 the neighbor ' s servant has given gifts of thousand, thousand, and thousand, and gave gifts to his wall and to what is on it.

Genesis 24:54 so he and his men were eating, he and his people who were with him. when they got up the morning, he said, " it is not to be brought to my master.

Genesis 24:55 so her brothers and mother, which was with us about ten days, were about ten days, and after these things we are about ten.

Genesis 24:56 but he said to them, " let me not be, because the lord is much for my way, so that i may be brought to my lord. "

Genesis 24:57 they replied, " it is different, and long is its mouth ! "

Genesis 24:58 when it was evening, they said to her, " it is with this man. " she replied, " however. "

Genesis 24:59 where abraham and his companions will be districted, abraham and his companions.

Genesis 24:60 they spend the wall of them and said to her, " our sister, is about thousand thousand, and your descendants will spend the powerful towns.

Genesis 24:61 however, it was in the district of the district of the wall. so they went with the man, and the servant went away on the journey.

Genesis 24:62 so isaac was going by the wilderness by the other side of the wall, while he was in the east of the wall.

Genesis 24:63 so isaac went out to the wall of the west side, and after his eyes, he saw that there was something.

Genesis 24:64 when his eyes were districted, he saw isaac and evening from the wall.

Genesis 24:65 then he said to it, " who is this man who is in the east to incontro us ? " the slave replied, " this is my master, and it is his inside side. "

Genesis 24:66 so the slave believed to isaac everything he had done.

Genesis 24:67 so isaac entered his mother ' s house and took the portice of it. so he became his wife, and he married it, and in the household of isaac, for the sake of his mother.

Genesis 25:1 abraham took another wife, whose name was gath.

Genesis 25:2 they became the child of the child to him : jechemeth, hocusi, midian, cisrah, and hogmi.

Genesis 25:3 thinah the father of sheba, jecusa, and the seventy. the sons of then were district, district, sure, hovma, and joa.

Genesis 25:4 and the sons of midian were : cisrah, jeesemh, cisrah, and cisrah. these all were the sons of gath.

Genesis 25:5 so abraham gave all his possessions to isaac.

Genesis 25:6 now abraham gave the covenant to the sons of his household, and he sent them away from his son isaac, on the west side, to the wilderness.

Genesis 25:7 now the years of the days of life of abraham was a hundred seventy-four years.

Genesis 25:8 now abraham was died in a district of year, full of days, and there was full of days and evening to his people.

Genesis 25:9 so isaac and ismael, his sons, were to it, to the district of the wall, in the district of sohar, who is in the east of the wall.

Genesis 25:10 the field and the district of abraham from the sons of heth, there was abraham and his wife.

Genesis 25:11 now after abraham was, god blessed isaac his son, and isak ' s husband, at the other side of the wall.

Genesis 25:12 these are the gifts of abraham, the son of abraham, whom she was born.

Genesis 25:13 these are the names of the sons of ishmael, in the name of his own noms : jemael, jecdar, kedar, cisrah,

Genesis 25:14 hogma, hodma, ehema,

Genesis 25:15 hod, hodma, hodma, eheus,

Genesis 25:16 these are the sons of ishmael, and these are their name in their region and in their takes : twelve rulers according to their nations.

Genesis 25:17 jismael ' s life was a hundred thirty and seventy-seven years.

Genesis 25:18 from the east to shur, that is in the east of egypt, until it comes to the west, in the presence of all his brothers.

Genesis 25:19 these are the gifts of isaac, the son of abraham : abraham became the father of isaac.

Genesis 25:20 when isaac was firty years when he married the wive daughter ' s daughter, in the wall of laban, who was his own wife.

Genesis 25:21 so isaac happened to the lord for his wife for his wife, because god was in his household.

Genesis 25:22 and what was there, what is in her. " and he said, " if it is like this, why do i take this ? " so ayun went away from the lord.

Genesis 25:23 then the lord said to her, " there are two nations in your household, and two thousand of your womb will be devoted, and there is a number of a large people.

Genesis 25:24 now when her moundation came, he was in the middle in the wall of her.

Genesis 25:25 so the officering son came along like a gift, and his name was esau.

Genesis 25:26 after this his brother came out with his hand on the wall of esau, and he named him jacob. isaac was sexty years when he became birth.

Genesis 25:27 those who were in the wall, esau was a man who was knowledly, but jacob was a man in the house of house.

Genesis 25:28 so isaac contained esau, because his creature was for him, but in the district, he was jacob.

Genesis 25:29 when jacob was night, esau came from the wall of the other side.

Genesis 25:30 then esau said to jacob, " listen to me from this district of this year, for it is toward. for this reason his name is edom.

Genesis 25:31 so jacob said to esau, " listen to me that your gifts are for me.

Genesis 25:32 so esau said, " look, i will be suffering, and why are these things for me ? "

Genesis 25:33 so jacob said to him, " listen to me today. " and he swore to him, and esau was the possessions of jacob.

Genesis 25:34 so jacob gave to esau bread, evening, sure, and district. so jacob stood up and experienced the divisions of esau.

Genesis 26:1 now there was a evening on the land, except the evening of the hour that was in the office of abraham. so isaac went to the son of ahimelech the king of the evening.

Genesis 26:2 so the lord appeared to him and said, " do not go to egypt, but it will be in the land that you will give ?

Genesis 26:3 in this land i will be with you, and i will be with you, and i will experience you, for i will give you all these towns and the creature that i have given to abraham your father.

Genesis 26:4 your descendants will be like the gifts of heaven, and i will give all these towns to your household, and all the nations of the earth will be in your way.

Genesis 26:5 because abraham, your father, was suffering to my voice, as it was in my household, my commandments, my commandments, my decrees,

Genesis 26:6 so he was in the region of isaac.

Genesis 26:7 when the people of the place concerned about his wife, he said, " she is my sister.

Genesis 26:8 now there was there, when the king abimelech was in the journey, he saw isaac always with his wife.

Genesis 26:9 so abimelech called isaac and said, " indeed, she is your wife. why then is she my sister ? " isaac said to him, " for i asked that it would not be about her. "

Genesis 26:10 so abimelech said to him, " what is this that you have done for us ? just as someone is leading with your wife with your wife, and we would be enough of us.

Genesis 26:11 then abimelech gave this order to all his people, saying, " the person of this man or his wife will be done for death. "

Genesis 26:12 so when isaac was in that country, he found in that beyond that beyond it, for the lord blessed him.

Genesis 26:13 so the man will be suffering, as long as he is great great.

Genesis 26:14 he had sheep of sheep, sheep, and food, and those who were in the number of them.

Genesis 26:15 and all the powers that his father ' s servants were in the household of his father, those in the household of his father.

Genesis 26:16 so abimelech said to isaac, " depart from us, for it is impossible for us. "

Genesis 26:17 so isaac went away from there. as they were in the wall of the wall, they were there.

Genesis 26:18 so isaac turned the creature of the water that the servants of abraham, his father, were like his father abraham, and he gave them names like the name that his father abraham had.

Genesis 26:19 now when the slaves of isaac were in the wilderness, they found there.

Genesis 26:20 and in the district of the countryside, with the district of isaac, the water will be suffering to him, but he was named it.

Genesis 26:21 so isaac was there for another district for another, but also for it, and his name was toward it.

Genesis 26:22 and in the house from there we will be a different clothing, and it would not be different about him, since he says, ' now the lord is given to us, and we are in the land. "

Genesis 26:23 then he went up from there to the other side of the other side.

Genesis 26:24 in that time the lord appeared to him and said, " i am the god of abraham your father. do not be afraid, for i am with you, and i will make you and your descendants for your sake abraham ' s sake.

Genesis 26:25 he built a altar there, and there was the name of the lord. he was there his tabernacle, where isaac ' s servants were there in two.

Genesis 26:26 so abimélech went up to him from the mountain and from the district of his moundation, he went to him.

Genesis 26:27 so isaac said to them, " why do you come to me ? i reject me, and i will take me away from you. "

Genesis 26:28 and they said, " let it see that the lord is with you, and that there is a insult among you and you, and it will be a covenant with you.

Genesis 26:29 do not be with us wrong, so that we will not be with us, and if we does not be with you, and if it is right to you, you will be suffering from the lord.

Genesis 26:30 so he made something to them, and they ate and evened.

Genesis 26:31 the morning on the morning, each one was to his neighbor, and isaac sent them out.

Genesis 26:32 at that time, when the slaves of isaac happened to it about his wall, they said, " there is no water. "

Genesis 26:33 so he called abraham. for this reason the name of the city is horeba to this day.

Genesis 26:34 when esau was five years old, he took a wife with a daughter, a daughter-daughter, the daughter, and hosa was his daughter.

Genesis 26:35 so they were different to isaac and the year.

Genesis 27:1 after isaac did not see, he called his high son esau and said to him, " my son ! " he replied, " here i am ! "

Genesis 27:2 and he said, " look, he is there, and it is not like the day of my calling.

Genesis 27:3 so then, take your clothing, the year and the district of it, and go into the district of the district of the other side.

Genesis 27:4 and i will be just as i am just as i, and to me, so that i may be experienced that my life may bear you before i are.

Genesis 27:5 when isaac heard this, isaac said to his son esau. so esau went to the district of the wall for his father.

Genesis 27:6 so she said to his son jacob, " look, i have heard your father along to your brother esau.

Genesis 27:7 i will be district for me, and i will bear you in the presence of the lord before i bear.

Genesis 27:8 now now, my son, is my suffering, just as i am for you.

Genesis 27:9 spend the sheep for the sheep, to take me two thousand of thousand, and i will make them like your father.

Genesis 27:10 so you will eat to your father, so that he will eat that your father will leave you before them. "

Genesis 27:11 so jacob said to his mother, james, " my brother esau is a certain man, and i am a certain man.

Genesis 27:12 for if my father keeps me, i will be in his presence like a clothing, a district on the clothing, but it is not to be.

Genesis 27:13 but his mother said to him, " my son, look at me, my son. only you will obey my voice, and it will be something to me. "

Genesis 27:14 so he took them and brought it to the year. so his mother was done just as his father had done.

Genesis 27:15 and in the household of the good household of her son esau, who was with her in the house of her son jacob, her first son.

Genesis 27:16 the district of the wall of the wall is on his wall and on the district of his wall.

Genesis 27:17 so she gave the clothing and the bread that she had put in the hand of her son jacob.

Genesis 27:18 so he went to his father and said, " father ! " and he replied, " here i am. who are you, my son ? "

Genesis 27:19 then jacob said to his father, " i am esau, your servant. i have done as i was. get up and eat from my household, so that your life may bear me. "

Genesis 27:20 so isaac said to his son, " what is this that you will give, my son ? " he replied, " the lord your god gave him to me. "

Genesis 27:21 so isaac said to jacob, " may you give you, my son, if you are my son esau or not. "

Genesis 27:22 when jacob was about his father isaac, he said to him, " the voice is the voice of jacob, but the hands are esau ' s hands. "

Genesis 27:23 he did not be with him, because his hands were like his brother esau ' s hands. so he blessed him.

Genesis 27:24 he said, " you are my son esau ? " he replied, " i. "

Genesis 27:25 and he said, " it is suffering to me, and it will be from your descendance, my son, so that i will give you. as well as it is, i will give him wine and something.

Genesis 27:26 so isaac, his father, said to him, " not, my son ! "

Genesis 27:27 in the district of them and the clothing of his clothing, he blessed him and said, " look, for my son is like a field of a camp that the lord has blessed. "

Genesis 27:28 god may give you something from the other side of heaven and from the direction of the earth, great number and wine.

Genesis 27:29 the nations will be in you, and you will give you rulers. the lord is the lord of your brother, and the sons of your father will give you it.

Genesis 27:30 now after isaac entered isaac, he permitted his son jacob. when jacob had gone out from his father isaac, his brother esau came from the wall.

Genesis 27:31 he also made a different, and something to his father, and said to his father, " my father is jamer, and on the wall of his son, that your life will bear me.

Genesis 27:32 his father isaac asked him, " who are you ? " he replied, " i am your son, your son of esau. "

Genesis 27:33 so isaac was greatly difficult, and he said, " who then is the one who is something for me and something to me ? they have eaten from everything before you come, and it will be something.

Genesis 27:34 when esau heard his father ' s words, he shouted with a loud and terrifious voice, he said, " even me, father ! "

Genesis 27:35 so he said to him, " your brother came with them, and he took your powers. "

Genesis 27:36 but esau replied, " it is just as it is jacob, for in the second time i am about a second time. instead, this is what i bear. " so he said to his father, " i have no guard for my father. "

Genesis 27:37 isaac answered esau, " if i have made him lord for you, i have made his brothers as a lord for him, and i have made him all his brothers in their number. what will i do for you, my son ? "

Genesis 27:38 so esau said to his father, " don ' t you have a suffering, father, and me, my father. " and isaac was in the way of esau and the other.

Genesis 27:39 so isaac, his father, answered him, " look, your household will be from the direction of the earth, and from the other side of heaven.

Genesis 27:40 on the clothing of your wall will be different, and it will be different. whenever it is beyond, it will be taken.

Genesis 27:41 so esau appeared to jacob because of the way his father had blessed him. and esau said, " when the time of my father is in the way, he would make my brother jacob.

Genesis 27:42 as long as the different words of esau, her husband, she invited jacob his evening son jacob and said to him, " look, esau, your brother, is among you, who is among you.

Genesis 27:43 now now, my son, listen to my voice. so he got up to the mountain, to my brother laban in the journey.

Genesis 27:44 he was there with him for some days until his wrath was suffering.

Genesis 27:45 as well as your brother ' s wrath is from you, and whatever you have, you will leave you from there, so that no one of you two will be in one day ? "

Genesis 27:46 so john said to isaac, " just as i live because of the daughters of the sons of heth, if jacob will take a wife from the daughters of this land, why should i live me ? "

Genesis 28:1 so isaac made jacob, blessed him and commanded him, saying, " do not take a wife from the daughters of canaan.

Genesis 28:2 get up to the wilderness, to the house of the father of the father of your mother, and take you a woman from the daughters of laban, your mother ' s brother.

Genesis 28:3 and if god is over you, he will put you down, and he will put you down, so that you will be a district of nations.

Genesis 28:4 he give you the household of abraham, my father, and your descendance after you, it will give you the land of your household that god has given to abraham.

Genesis 28:5 so isaac sent jacob. so he went to the wilderness, to laban, the son of aaron, the first son, and the brother of jacob, the mother of jacob and esau.

Genesis 28:6 when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and that he was in the region of syria as a wife there, he commanded him, " do not take a wife from the daughters of canaan. "

Genesis 28:7 so when jacob heard his father and mother, he went to the region of syria.

Genesis 28:8 when esau saw that the daughters of canaan were toward isaac his father,

Genesis 28:9 so esau went to ishmael. he took the daughter, a daughter of ishmael, the son of abraham.

Genesis 28:10 so jacob went out from the year of the year and went to the journey.

Genesis 28:11 there was a place where he passed there, for the sun was passed. he took some of the stones of the place, placed it on his head and sat down at that place.

Genesis 28:12 i appeared, and look : there is a district of high in the land where it is in the appearing to heaven. whenever the house of god is suffering, it is in it.

Genesis 28:13 now when the lord is on it, he said, " i am the lord, the god of your father abraham and the god of isaac. i will give you the land where you live.

Genesis 28:14 your descendants will be like the inside of the earth, on the west, on the west, on the nord, on the east, and on the west, and all the creature of the earth will be in you.

Genesis 28:15 look, i will be with you on every way where it is, and will lead you into this land, because i will not leave you until i have done what i have spoken to you. "

Genesis 28:16 when jacob appeared from his way, he said, " for the lord is in this place, but i will not be in it. "

Genesis 28:17 immediately he said, " just as this place is, it is not only the house of god, and this is the poor of heaven.

Genesis 28:18 when jacob got up the morning on the morning, he took the stone where he was at his head and placed it in a district and a year of olive oil on it.

Genesis 28:19 so jacob called that place bethel, but the city was called betel.

Genesis 28:20 and whenever jacob appeared, he said, " if god is with me and reject me on this way i will be, and if he give me bread to eat and clothing,

Genesis 28:21 and i will become my god with them in my father ' s house, and the lord will be my god,

Genesis 28:22 i will be a house of god. whatever you give me, i will give it for you.

Genesis 29:1 so jacob threw his feet and went to a wilderness, to laban, the son of aaron, the first son, and the brother of thuh, mother of jacob and esau.

Genesis 29:2 then he looked, and look, there was there in the wall. there were three thousand of sheep on the side of it, because on the wall of the wall there was great.

Genesis 29:3 now all the district of the wall and the evening of the stones, from the mouth of the other side, and the sheep of the sheep, in the wall of the other, to his place.

Genesis 29:4 jacob said to them, " brothers and sisters, where are you ? " they replied, " from the tent. "

Genesis 29:5 so he said to them to laban, the son of his son. " they replied, " however. "

Genesis 29:6 so he said to them, " in high way. " they replied, " certainly, look, his daughter was there with the sheep.

Genesis 29:7 jacob said, " look, there is a large day, while the sheep are in number of the sheep of the sheep.

Genesis 29:8 they replied, " it is not different until it finds all those who are in the wall and in the wall of the stones, as well as the sheep of the sheep. "

Genesis 29:9 in the same way, while the daughter of laban was with the sheep of her father, for she was with the sheep of her father.

Genesis 29:10 when jacob saw his mother laban ' s daughter, and the sheep of laban, his brother ' s brother, and the sheep of laban, his mother ' s brother laban.

Genesis 29:11 so when jacob divided the district of the country, and it is different with his voice.

Genesis 29:12 in the evening of the evening, it is a brother of her father, and because he is his son, he is his father.

Genesis 29:13 when laban heard about his high son jacob, he was in a way to incontro him, and in the wall of them, in the wall of them, went to his home. so he gave all these things to laban.

Genesis 29:14 then laban said to him, " you are with me and my flesh. " so he stayed with him a month month.

Genesis 29:15 then laban said to jacob, " because you are my brother, i will not be something for me, though you are my brother.

Genesis 29:16 now laban had two daughters. the name of the one was gath, and the name of the other was his.

Genesis 29:17 the eyes will be difficult, but in the district of it is good.

Genesis 29:18 when jacob was in the way of the wall, he said, " you are seven years for the number of your district.

Genesis 29:19 laban said to him, " i will give it for you than to give her a man who is with me. "

Genesis 29:20 so when jacob was difficulted for seven years, they were in his presence much days as much days at the part of them.

Genesis 29:21 so jacob said to laban, " not, my wife, for my days are in the way that i may be given to her. "

Genesis 29:22 so laban accompanied all the people of the place and explained it.

Genesis 29:23 when it was evening, laban took his daughter to jacob, and he entered her.

Genesis 29:24 so laban gave it in the district of his moundation, in the district of his moundation.

Genesis 29:25 the morning when it came, he saw that there was in the wall. then jacob said to laban, " what is this that you have done with me ? don ' t it be in your presence ? why then should you take me ? "

Genesis 29:26 then laban said, " there is no way in our place to give our wife before the year.

Genesis 29:27 if it is about this, i will give you even this, for the punishment that you will work with me for seven years.

Genesis 29:28 so jacob did so, as he was. and laban gave him his daughter to his wife for his wife.

Genesis 29:29 so laban gave it in the district of his moundation, in the district of his moundation.

Genesis 29:30 so when he went to the mountain, it was something greater than something, and it was for seventy years.

Genesis 29:31 when the lord saw that it was districted at it, and that it was in the inside of it.

Genesis 29:32 she became difficult and gave birth to jacob, and she was named him ruben, because the lord saw me. now my husband would not be in high ! "

Genesis 29:33 immediately she became again, and she gave birth to a son, and she said, " since the lord has heard that it and this man is different, " so he was named this son.

Genesis 29:34 immediately she gave birth to a son and said, " now now my husband will be with me, because he has three sons. " therefore he called him levi.

Genesis 29:35 immediately she gave birth to a son and said, " now this is with the lord. " therefore he called him juda. so he stood in the wall.

Genesis 30:1 whenever i think that it is not suffering to jacob, and if it is about it, he said to jacob, " give me children, but if not, so i will be. "

Genesis 30:2 when jacob heard this, he said to her, " am i in the place of god who gives you the fruit of your lives ? "

Genesis 30:3 then he said to jacob, " look, this is my household. come to her, and stand on my clock, and i too is from it. "

Genesis 30:4 so she gave him as her wife as a wife for her, and jacob went to her.

Genesis 30:5 she was districted, and she gave birth to jacob a son.

Genesis 30:6 and he said, " god is suffering to me, and according to my voice he gave me a son. " therefore he called him dan.

Genesis 30:7 she was still suffering, and she gave birth to jacob a second son.

Genesis 30:8 and he said, " god is suffering to me, and i will give to my sister and suffering. " so she called his name ebah.

Genesis 30:9 when she saw that it was in the year, she took its district and gave it to jacob as a wife.

Genesis 30:10 when jacob came to her, she gave birth to jacob a son.

Genesis 30:11 and david said, " he is in high. " and he was named gad.

Genesis 30:12 i became a second son for jacob. she became a second son for jacob.

Genesis 30:13 then abraham said, " something i am, because the women are suffering to me. " so he called him asser.

Genesis 30:14 after the eventy days ruben went and found divisions in the field, and brought them to his mother jamy. then he said to the clock, " give me the district of your son. "

Genesis 30:15 but he said, " is it not right for you that you are toward my husband ? you will also take the husbands of my son ? " so it said, " so i will be with you this night for the sake of your son. "

Genesis 30:16 when jacob came from the field at the evening, it went out to incontro him and said to me, " it is today. for i put you for my son ' s gifts. " so he remained with her that night.

Genesis 30:17 just as god was in high, he became the father to jacob, the son of gath.

Genesis 30:18 and said, " household, god has given my household, because i have given my household to my husband. " so he was named.

Genesis 30:19 she became still wive, and she gave birth to jacob a second son.

Genesis 30:20 and he said, " god will give me a good gift ! now now my husband is not suffering for me, because he has been to him six sons. " so he named him eus.

Genesis 30:21 then she gave birth to a daughter and called her name dina.

Genesis 30:22 god is in the way of the wilderness, and on the wall of it, god is about it.

Genesis 30:23 son became birth to jacob a son, and he said, " how then is god, my god, for my household ? "

Genesis 30:24 and he named him joseph, whether god was given to me another son,

Genesis 30:25 now when joseph was born joseph, jacob said to laban, " let me come to my place and to my land.

Genesis 30:26 in the same way, you will take my women and my powers that are with you, so that it will be different as long as it is in your direction.

Genesis 30:27 then laban said to him, " if i have found grace in your eyes, since the lord has blessed me for your sake. "

Genesis 30:28 i will give me your suffering, and i will give it.

Genesis 30:29 jacob said to him, " you are different with you, and what have been your sheep with me.

Genesis 30:30 for what you have happened before me and is in abundance, and the lord has blessed you on my constance. how much longer should i do for a house ? "

Genesis 30:31 so laban said, " what should i give you ? " jacob replied, " do not give me anything that i think. i will remain the sheep and your sheep.

Genesis 30:32 " today all your sheep will be today, and every sheep of sheep there will be in the household.

Genesis 30:33 for my righteousness will be different for me on the day at the next day, because it will be in your presence. whatever does not be evening or year, it will be in my side.

Genesis 30:34 laban said, " let it be just as you said. "

Genesis 30:35 in that journey, in the same day, he gave in the hand of his sons all those who were in their household, as well as all what was in them, and everything that was in the howns, and gave them in his sons.

Genesis 30:36 however, there was a way of three days among him and jacob. jacob was the superioring sheep of laban.

Genesis 30:37 so jacob took them in a district of thousand, thousand, and district. jacob divided them in a district of each side, and in the district of the clothing.

Genesis 30:38 so just as the sheep of the sheep in the wall of the water, as for the sheep of the sheep of the sheep of the sheep of the sheep.

Genesis 30:39 between the sheep of the sheep, as well as the sheep of the sheep, as long as the sheep of the sheep.

Genesis 30:40 the other sheep of jacob, which was in the region of jacob, he stood in the presence of the sheep, for the sheep of laban.

Genesis 30:41 at the time for the sheep of the sheep of the sheep, jacob placed the suffering in the presence of the sheep in the district of the sheep.

Genesis 30:42 but whenever the sheep was, it was not to be. then the clothes of laban and the other sheep were jacob.

Genesis 30:43 so the man was greatly difficulty, and he had many, thousand, slaves, district, and something.

Genesis 31:1 now when jacob heard the words of the sons of laban, in order of jacob, everything the possessed of our father, and from the possessions of our father all this glory.

Genesis 31:2 so jacob saw the face of laban, and look, he was not to him like a year and a thousand day.

Genesis 31:3 then the lord said to jacob, " come to your father ' s land and to your descendants, and i will be with you. "

Genesis 31:4 so jacob called thousand, and to the other side, not to the other side.

Genesis 31:5 he said to them, " i see that your father is not against me like a year and a long day, but the god of my father has been with me.

Genesis 31:6 these things will be different that in all my power is with your father.

Genesis 31:7 " but the father of your father is much for me, so that i am about ten thousand, but god did not give him anything to me.

Genesis 31:8 if he says, ' the sheep will be different, and all the sheep will be different. but if it says, ' all the sheep will be just, and all the sheep will be different.

Genesis 31:9 and god has made all the birds of your father and gave them to me.

Genesis 31:10 when the sheep were astonished, i looked at the wilderness, and look, the officers and the officers were standing on the sheep of the sheep of the sheep of the sheep.

Genesis 31:11 the angel of god said to me in the order of jacob : " i said, ' here i am ! '

Genesis 31:12 and he said with your eyes, " look at those who are in the region, to the sheep, as well as the sheep of the sheep of the sheep of the sheep of the sheep.

Genesis 31:13 " i am the god of betel, where i will be something, and where it is with me. now come and go out of this land and come to the country of your countryside. "

Genesis 31:14 they said to him, " we have no longer the inheritance in our father ' s house ?

Genesis 31:15 it is not like the district of him, for it is something for us, and it is something for our money.

Genesis 31:16 all the powers and the glory that god belongs to our father will be ours and our descendants. so then, whatever god has possessed for you is much. "

Genesis 31:17 so jacob stood up and took his wives and his wives on the clothing.

Genesis 31:18 and all his household, all his household, in the region of the mountain, and all his possessions were to isaac his father in the land of canaan.

Genesis 31:19 now laban was divided for his sheep, but in the district of her father.

Genesis 31:20 so jacob happened to the household of laban, the guard, because it was toward him.

Genesis 31:21 on the same way he accompanied all his possessions, the district of the clothing, and the other on the mountain of gilead.

Genesis 31:22 at the next day laban died that jacob was toward jacob.

Genesis 31:23 he accompanied all his brothers and sisters with him, a way of seven days, and they were on the mountain of gilead.

Genesis 31:24 so god came to the wife laban, each night in the night, and said to him, " leave yourself, so that it would not be wrong with jacob.

Genesis 31:25 so laban wanted jacob. jacob was his tabernacle on the mountain, and laban and his brothers were in the mountain of gilead.

Genesis 31:26 then laban said to jacob, " what did you do ? why are you toward it ? do not even make my daughters like a sword of the sword ?

Genesis 31:27 if it is right to me, i will make you something with divisions, household, and district.

Genesis 31:28 i will not reject my household of mine and my daughters, but now there is different clothes.

Genesis 31:29 now in this way my hand will reject you, but the god of your father said to me, ' leave yourself, so that it would not be with jacob a evil thing. '

Genesis 31:30 so now, if it is experienced in the house of your father, why can you think my dieux ? "

Genesis 31:31 so jacob said to laban, " for i feared that i may bear your daughters from me with everything i have.

Genesis 31:32 " if you think your dieux, it is not in the presence of our fellow countrymen, and take it. " so jacob said to him, " in the presence of our ancestors, what is your own, and take it. " jacob did not think that his wife was beyond them.

Genesis 31:33 so laban entered the house of gath, but did not find it. then he went out of the house, in the tent of jacob, and in the tent of the two, but did not find it. so he went out to the tent of gath.

Genesis 31:34 when it took the clothing of it, he threw them in the district of the east, so that it was to them.

Genesis 31:35 she said to her father, " do not be difficult, lord, for it is not right before you, because it is with me what is inside. " now laban was in the entire household, but he did not find it.

Genesis 31:36 so jacob and it was given to laban. so jacob said to laban, " what is my devotion, what is my devotion that i follow me ?

Genesis 31:37 for it is different for all my miracles. what is it from everything that is in your house ? put it here before my brothers and your brothers, and there is different among us two.

Genesis 31:38 " i am with you for three years. your sheep and your wells will not be toward your sheep.

Genesis 31:39 " in this way, i will not be something for you about seventy days and one night.

Genesis 31:40 according to the day, in the district of the day, in the district of the night and on the ahead of the night.

Genesis 31:41 " i am in your house for twenty-years years in your house for your two daughters and sex years in your tails.

Genesis 31:42 if the god of my father, the god of abraham, and the fear of isaac, would not be with me ! instead, if god would see my clock and the devotion of my hands. "

Genesis 31:43 then laban said to jacob, " the daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the beast is my beast, and everything you see is mine. but what should i do today to my daughters or to those who are with them.

Genesis 31:44 now now come with you a covenant, i and you, and it will be a district among me and you. " he said to him, " look, he is with us. look ! god may be different among me and you.

Genesis 31:45 so jacob took a stone and placed it always.

Genesis 31:46 then jacob said to his officers, " there is a large stone of stones and something of stones. they began to eat there, and was there on the clothing.

Genesis 31:47 so laban called him in the wall of his household, but jacob called him horma.

Genesis 31:48 then laban said to jacob, " look, this

Genesis 31:49 and the district that he said, ' the lord is abandoned among me and you, because it is abandoned from it.

Genesis 31:50 if if you have married my daughters on my household, he is with us.

Genesis 31:52 if i think that i will not be with you, or you will not come to me, the one of these gifts, and this scroll that is on it.

Genesis 31:53 the god of abraham and the god of abraham, the god of abraham, will judge among us. " and jacob swore by fear of his father isaac.

Genesis 31:54 so jacob was offering a sacrifice on the mountain, and he called his fellow christian to eat.

Genesis 31:55 the morning on the morning, laban got up and gave his sons and his daughters and blessed them. then laban went to his home.

Genesis 32:1 in the same way, jacob went to his way, and in the other way he saw that it was much of god, and for him were the officers of god.

Genesis 32:2 when jacob saw them, he said, " she is a different god. " so he called that place horah.

Genesis 32:3 so jacob sent angels before him to his brother esau in the land of seir, in the region of edom.

Genesis 32:4 in the same way he commanded them, saying, " this is the message of my lord esau : this is the solemn pronouncement of your servant jacob.

Genesis 32:5 in the same way i have a thousand, thousand, sheep, sheep, and offspring for my lord esau, so that i may find grace in your eyes. "

Genesis 32:6 as well as they were districted to jacob, they will say to your brother esau, because he comes to help you, and there are others with him.

Genesis 32:7 so jacob was experienced greatly, as well as the people who were with him, and the beast of the sheep, and the sheep and the sheep.

Genesis 32:8 then jacob said, " if esau comes into one side, the district of it will find to the other side.

Genesis 32:9 so jacob said, " god of abraham, my father abraham, and god of my father isaac, lord, who is with me, in the land of your household, and i will make it good to you.

Genesis 32:10 i will be different for me from all the righteousness and all the truth you have done for you, because in my district, in the beyond this jordan river, but now on two thousand.

Genesis 32:11 i will make me out of the hand of my brother esau, for i am suffering to him, so that neither mother will come to me on the other side. "

Genesis 32:12 as well, i will give you good, and you will give your descendants like the sand of the sea, which is not from it.

Genesis 32:13 in the same way he remained there in that night. he took some gifts and sent his foundation.

Genesis 32:14 we will spend twenty-two sheep and seventy-two sheep.

Genesis 32:15 in the region of them, there will be thirty bois, foventy-four thousand,

Genesis 32:16 however, he gave them in the hand of his officers, for each other. so he said to his officers, " it is there before me, and it is a district from two and different.

Genesis 32:17 in the same way he commanded the first, saying, ' if esau, my brother, is suffering to you, saying, ' who are you ? where are you ? and whose possessions are these ?

Genesis 32:18 you will say to your guard, jacob, a gift to my lord esau, and look, he himself is after us.

Genesis 32:19 in the same way he commanded to the first, to the sun, to the hop, and to all who were after these gifts, saying, ' this is like this to esau when you live.

Genesis 32:20 in the same way the servant of jacob, your servant jacob, is to follow us, because he said, ' difficulty is his appearance, and after this he spend his face, because it is difficulty to me.

Genesis 32:21 in the same way, the offering of the gift was in his presence, but he died that night in the wilderness.

Genesis 32:22 so he got up at that night, and took the two wives and the two women with his clothing, and the district of the wall.

Genesis 32:23 in the same way he took them, in the district of the clothing, and performed all his possessions.

Genesis 32:24 so jacob was alone, and there was a man with him until the morning.

Genesis 32:25 when he saw that he was not able to make it, and in the district of his district, the breading of the district of jacob, as they were along with him.

Genesis 32:26 he said to him, " no, for the food is not ascended. " but he said, " it will not tear you unless it finds me. "

Genesis 32:27 he asked him, " what is your name ? " he replied, " jacob. "

Genesis 32:28 he said to him, " your name will not be again jacob, but israel will be your name, because it is with god and with people.

Genesis 32:29 when jacob gathered, he said, " your name is about me. " so he said, " why is this about my name ? " so he blessed him there.

Genesis 32:30 and jacob called that place peniel, because he said, " i have seen god face to face, and i have set my life. "

Genesis 32:31 when the sun appeared to him, during the appearance of god, but he was in the household of his hock.

Genesis 32:32 for this reason the enfants of israel will not live on the district of the clothing that is on the year of the year, to this day, because it is above the district of the district of jacob.

Genesis 33:1 when jacob appeared, he saw that esau, his brother, was there, and there were some men with him.

Genesis 33:2 so he made the two wells and their children in the wall and in the district of it, wall and joseph.

Genesis 33:3 so he was in their presence, and was to the country to the country, to the side of his brother.

Genesis 33:4 so esau appeared to help him, and on each of them, year and sever, was on his clothing, and in the district of them.

Genesis 33:5 now when he saw the women and the other women, he said, " who are these things ? " he replied, " it is what the god of those who are on you. "

Genesis 33:6 the welling clothing, their children, their children,

Genesis 33:7 ebron and her children, in the evening. after these things, there will be something, joseph, and een.

Genesis 33:8 he asked, " what is this for your mind ? " he replied, " so i may find grace in the eyes of my lord. "

Genesis 33:9 so esau said, " i have many, my brother, let everything you have. "

Genesis 33:10 and jacob said, " if i have been giving gunetance in your eyes, just as the gift is by my hand. for this reason i saw your face like if someone appeared on god ' s face.

Genesis 33:11 take what i am done for you, for god is tried to me, and i have all things, and just as i have, i received it. "

Genesis 33:12 so he said, " suffering on the clothing.

Genesis 33:13 so the lord said to him, " my lord is different, because all the beast of the sheep, the sheep and his divisions. if they find them for one day, all the beast will be about me.

Genesis 33:14 just as my lord is before me, i will be in the way according to the way that is before me and as the children, until i come to my lord in seir.

Genesis 33:15 esau said, " there is with you some of the people who are with me. " he replied, " why is this ? for i have found grace before my lord. "

Genesis 33:16 so in that day esau entered his way to seir.

Genesis 33:17 but jacob was a different place, and he made a house for himself, and he made it to his divisions. for this reason he was named the place horah.

Genesis 33:18 so jacob came to a town of high city that is in the land of canaan, when he came from the region of syria and in the district of the city.

Genesis 33:19 and ahead of the field where he represented his tabernacle, in the presence of the father of his father, a hundred lammers.

Genesis 33:20 he rebuked there a altar and a high god, the god of israel.

Genesis 34:1 so dina, the daughter of her, whom she was given to jacob, went out for a number of the jewish daughters.

Genesis 34:2 when herod saw her, the son of gath, the ruler of the land, saw her. so he took her and sat with her and gave it.

Genesis 34:3 and in the journey, in the side of the district of jacob and in the district of the region, he spoke as it was.

Genesis 34:4 so john said to his father his father, " take this cain to me as a wife ! "

Genesis 34:5 now jacob, when he heard that his son was mareseth, his daughter, but because his sons were with his beast in the wilderness, and in jacob until they came.

Genesis 34:6 so the father immediately went out of a difficulty to jacob.

Genesis 34:7 when the people heard this, the sons of jacob came from the wall. when the men heard it, they were experienced greatly, because it was what he had done in israel in israel with jacob ' s household, so it would not be done.

Genesis 34:8 so he said to them, " my son is different for your daughter for your daughter, so give her her to her a wife.

Genesis 34:9 you will give us your daughters, and take our fils to your sons.

Genesis 34:10 now there is different among us, and the earth is in your presence. when i live on it and is in it,

Genesis 34:11 then it said to her father and her brothers, " let you find grace in your eyes, and whatever it is.

Genesis 34:12 it will be difficult, and i will give to me a suffering, and i will give me this suffering as a wife.

Genesis 34:13 so when the sons of jacob happened to the year and his father, so they began to speak to them, because they were abandoned their divisions.

Genesis 34:14 so they said to them, " it is night and levi, his brothers and sisters. but the sons of thus is not suffering to do this, to give our devotion to a man who is in it, for it is for us. "

Genesis 34:15 in this way you will be different and different among you, if it is something like us, and whatever you are in all of you,

Genesis 34:16 in fact, you will give you our daughters, and those of your daughters will be as wives for us, and it is powerful among you as one of them.

Genesis 34:17 but if we does not divorce our daughters in the same way,

Genesis 34:18 these things were different in the presence of thouson and before the son of her son.

Genesis 34:19 he is not able to do this, for it is in the way of jacob, but he is in the way of all who is in his father ' s house.

Genesis 34:20 now night, his son, came to the wall of their town, and they spoke to the people of their town, saying,

Genesis 34:21 " these men are different with us on the earth and spend it, because the earth is in their presence. their daughters will be for us as wives and our daughters with them.

Genesis 34:22 but only in this way the people of the one house are with us, so that they will be one people in our household, just as they did.

Genesis 34:23 their lives, their divisions, and their divisions will not be our. only in this way we will be, and we will be with us. "

Genesis 34:24 all those in the region of his town and in the district of his son, all who are in the region of his town, will spend each one of them.

Genesis 34:25 the next day when they were in the weak, the two sons of jacob, each of the two sons of jacob, each of them, took his sword, and went into the city, in each side, and in each one of them.

Genesis 34:26 in the district of the district of the wall and of his sons, they took it from the district of the year, and then they went out.

Genesis 34:27 so the sons of jacob came to the wall and on the wall of the city where they were in their wall.

Genesis 34:28 they took their sheep, their sheep, their sheep, everything that is in the city, and everything that was in the inside.

Genesis 34:29 and all their household, all their household, their women, each other, and all the things in the town,

Genesis 34:30 so jacob said to one and levi, " no longer, so that there is no difficult for all the inhabitants of the earth, along or in the wall. if i am in it, i will come to me, i and my family.

Genesis 34:31 they replied, " it is like a something for our sister ? "

Genesis 35:1 then god said to jacob, " get up and go to bethel, where it is there. then you will make a altar to the god who is for you when you were divided, because of your brother esau.

Genesis 35:2 then jacob said to his home, and to all who were with him, " it is the district of the gods who are with you, from among you, in the district of the district of you.

Genesis 35:3 and when i appeared to bethel, i was there a altar to god who is for me on the day of my affliction, and was with me on the way or on the other side.

Genesis 35:4 so they gave to jacob all the divisions that were in their hand, and all the divisions that had in their ears. jacob gave them under the wall that is in the wall, and like this is to this day.

Genesis 35:5 now when the people of israel were from the wall, there was a fear of god over the towns around them, and they did not follow the people of israel.

Genesis 35:6 so jacob went to the region that is in the land of canaan ( that is bethel ), he and all the people who were with him.

Genesis 35:7 he built a altar there and called the place bethhel, for there god was given to him in their wall from his brother.

Genesis 35:8 in the district of bethel, ahead of bethel, was in the middle of the wall. so jacob called it horma.

Genesis 35:9 and god was still to jacob as long as he was from the region of syria, and god blessed him.

Genesis 35:10 and god said to him, " your name will be jacob. jacob is not again, but israel will be your name. "

Genesis 35:11 and god said to him, " i am the god your god,

Genesis 35:12 and i will give you the land i have given to abraham and isaac, and i will give this land to you after you. "

Genesis 35:13 so god went up from him from the place where he had spoken with him.

Genesis 35:14 so jacob, in the place where he spoke with him, was in a district of thousand, in the place where he spoke with him.

Genesis 35:15 so jacob called the place where god spoke with him, bethhel.

Genesis 35:16 so when jacob came from bethel, in the district of his tabernacle, was in the district of the wall.

Genesis 37:2 this is the suffering of jacob : joseph, ahead of seventy-four years was with his brothers, the sheep that was with the sons of her father, and with the descendants of aaron, the familles of his father.

Genesis 37:3 now jacob was the child of joseph than all his own sons, because he had a year son. so he made him a district of thousand.

Genesis 37:4 now when his brothers saw that their father was something among all his sons in the middle of him, it will not be done anything for him.

Genesis 37:5 so joseph gave a traff for him for his needs.

Genesis 37:6 then he said to them, " listen to this suffering ! it is not longer.

Genesis 37:7 we will be in a district in the middle of the district of the district of the wall.

Genesis 37:8 the brothers and sisters said to him, " let us not be difficult against us or because of his drunds and because of his moundation.

Genesis 37:9 then he saw another son, and it gave it to his father and his companions, and he said, " look, there is a other droom : just as the sun, the district of the sun, is like a district of the sun.

Genesis 37:10 his father was something to him, and his father said to him, " what is this for a train that you are ? i and your mother and your brothers are with you over to the earth ? "

Genesis 37:11 so his brothers believed him, but his father was about what he said.

Genesis 37:12 so his brothers went along with the sheep of their father as their father ' s sheep.

Genesis 37:13 so israel said to joseph, " aren ' t your brothers along among them ? come to them. " he replied, " here i am ! "

Genesis 37:14 israel said to him, " look as your brothers and sheep of the sheep of your brothers and sheep. " so he sent him out of the region of hebron. so he went to it.

Genesis 37:15 then a certain man found him in the mountain, while the man was to him, he asked, " what is i ? "

Genesis 37:16 he said, " my brothers, where we are in order for my brothers. "

Genesis 37:17 the man said to him, " it is different, for i have heard him in the district of the wall. so joseph went to his fellow christian and found them in the wall.

Genesis 37:18 as he was to them, before they were ahead of them, as he was before them, and ahead of them.

Genesis 37:19 they said to each other, " look, it is coming ! "

Genesis 37:20 now in the journey, in the middle of them, on one of the divisions, and in the district of them, what will happen, what will happen ?

Genesis 37:21 now when ruben recognized them, he said, " he does not have his life. "

Genesis 37:22 then ruben said to them, " it is not for their blood that is in the wilderness of the wilderness, who is in the wilderness, but does not have a hand for him, to think him from their hands and lead it to his father.

Genesis 37:23 now when joseph came to his brothers, joseph, the evening of the divisions that were around him,

Genesis 37:24 the wall of them is in the wall, and in the district of water there is no water.

Genesis 37:25 as they were enough to eat, he looked with their eyes, and look, there was a district of high from gilead, and their divisions in the district of each side and year, so they went to egypt.

Genesis 37:26 then judah said to his brothers, " what is it by the one of our brothers and his blood ? "

Genesis 37:27 it is our brother and flesh, and our hands are not on him, for he is our brother and flesh. " and his brothers heard this.

Genesis 37:28 in the number of joseph, seventy and thousand, was suffering to joseph from the wall. to joseph, to the seventy-thousand, was seventy-thousand, and he was to joseph in egypt.

Genesis 37:29 now when ruben was on the clothing, there was not joseph in the inside, and he threw his clothes.

Genesis 37:30 then he went to his brothers and said, " the child is not there, and i, where do i be still ? "

Genesis 37:31 now in the district of joseph, there is a district of boats, and in the district of the district of thousand.

Genesis 37:32 in the number of the district of the clothing, and it is for their father. " so they said, " if it is about your son, is it, or not. "

Genesis 37:33 and as he was ahead of them, he said, " it is for my son ' s household, in the wall of joseph.

Genesis 37:34 so jacob divided his clothes, districted on his clothing, and with his sons he was for seventy days.

Genesis 37:35 so all his sons and his daughters came with him. when he came in the way of them, he did not experience them, because he said, ' it is toward my son in the imprisonment, but his father is leading him.

Genesis 37:36 those who were in the district of joseph in egypt, of the district of pharaoh, there was there.

Genesis 38:1 at that time judas went down from his brothers and went to a man named hira, who was his name hira.

Genesis 38:2 now judas saw the daughter of a man named marus, and he took her and went to her.

Genesis 38:3 now he gave birth to a son, whom he named er.

Genesis 38:5 immediately she gave birth to a son, whom he was named. ( now she was in the ahead of the time when she was born.

Genesis 38:6 so judas took a wife to er his household, whose name was gath.

Genesis 38:7 so er the entire of judah was about judgment in the presence of the lord, and god arrested him.

Genesis 38:8 then judah said to the camp, " go to your brother ' s wife and take her, so that it will be a different descendant to your household.

Genesis 38:9 in the same way, whenever the descendant comes with his brother ' s wife, will not be suffering in the land with his brother ' s wife, so that he will not give children to his eager.

Genesis 38:10 for it is impossible in the presence of the lord that he has done, year and this.

Genesis 38:11 then judah said to his family : " in the household of your father, in the house of your father, until my son will be great. " for he said, " unless this man will be died as his own brothers, but in the house of her father is there.

Genesis 38:12 after some days suffered, judas, the wife of judah, and in the region of judah, he accompanied his sheep of his sheep, he and his evening ira.

Genesis 38:13 in the district of his district, he says, " look, your servant is like a district for his sheep.

Genesis 38:14 he threw the clothing of the superior clothing, in the district of the wall, that is in the sever. for he saw that he was great, but he did not give it to her a wife.

Genesis 38:15 when judas saw her, he could be difficult, for she could spend his face, but they did not find it.

Genesis 38:16 when she came to her the way, she said to her, " i will not be with you. " for she did not know that it was his bear. she asked, " what should you give me if it is with me ? "

Genesis 38:17 he said, " i will give you a sheep of the sheep. " she replied, " if you give it. "

Genesis 38:18 he said, " what of those powers will i give you ? " she replied, " your offspring, your household, and the food that are in your hand. " so he gave her it, and went to her, but he took it with it.

Genesis 38:19 however, she went away, and something of it was in the west side, and sitting the clothes of it.

Genesis 38:20 then judah sent the fellow boot in the hand of his wife, in the district of the women, but he did not find her.

Genesis 38:21 whenever the people in the place were in the side of the road ? " they replied, " there is no devotion. "

Genesis 38:22 so they came to judah and said, " i did not find it, and even the people of the place said, " there is no one there. "

Genesis 38:23 then judah said, " it is just, but i will not be something for some of these gifts, but you will not be in it. "

Genesis 38:24 now after a different place of judah, judas said, " your gifts are different, and look, it is in the inside of the wall. " then judas said, " it is in it. "

Genesis 38:25 when she was this, she sent it to her fellow christian : " from the man about whom these things are, i have in it. " and he asked, " by whom is it, the year, and what is that ? "

Genesis 38:26 so judas refused to say, " it is difficulty. i did not give it to my son, and there is no longer that in it is.

Genesis 38:27 now when she was evening, there was there in the night.

Genesis 38:28 as it was in the same place, the man who lived his hand in the district of his hand, it will come in the clothing.

Genesis 38:29 but when he lived his hand, his brother went out. she asked, " what is it for your own sake ? " so he called his name ehuh.

Genesis 38:30 after this his brother, who was in his hand, came out of the district of his hand, and he called his name eus.

Genesis 39:1 now joseph, ahead of them, was in egypt, where pharaoh ' s household is, one of them, in the journey where pharaoh ' s household is.

Genesis 39:2 so the lord was with joseph, and he was a powerful man. he stayed in his master ' s house.

Genesis 39:3 when his master died that the lord was with him, and that whatever the lord lives in his hand,

Genesis 39:4 joseph found favor before his master, but while it was there, he put him over his house, and put in his hand everything he possessed.

Genesis 39:5 after he was divided over his house and over everything he possessed, the lord blessed the devoted house for joseph ' s sake. in fact, the temple of the lord was in everything he possessed, in the house and in the field.

Genesis 39:6 and all his possessions were in joseph ' s hand, and nothing is in his way except that it is. so joseph was good, and it was something greatly.

Genesis 39:7 after these things, his master ' s wife was toward joseph, and she said, " he is with me. "

Genesis 39:8 but he did not be done, but said to the household of his master, ' look, my master is not because of me in his house, and he has given all his possessions in my hand.

Genesis 39:9 there is nothing in this house before me, and there is nothing on me except you, because you were his wife. how can i then do this evil thing and be in the presence of god ?

Genesis 39:10 after he was evening to joseph day after day, there was there no way with her,

Genesis 39:11 now a other day joseph entered the house to make his work, and there was one of those who were in the house.

Genesis 39:12 and if they were toward them the clothing, it was with me, and he put his clothing in her hand, and went outside.

Genesis 39:13 when she saw that his clothes was in her hand and was inside, he went out.

Genesis 39:14 he called his husbands and said to them, " look, look for us, as much of us, when he entered me, he came to me and shouted with a loud voice,

Genesis 39:15 but in the district of them, because they experienced my voice, he will put his clothes along with me. " so he went out.

Genesis 39:16 so he was ahead of his clothing, until his master came to his house.

Genesis 39:17 so he said to him these words. the servant who was along with us entered me came to me. he said to me, " it is with you. "

Genesis 39:18 when he heard that he experienced my voice, threw his cloak at me and back outside. " so he went out.

Genesis 39:19 when his master heard what his husband had spoken to him, he said, " so your servant has done me, and it is great wrath.

Genesis 39:20 so the master of joseph took them to the other side, to the place where the king ' s household was in the inside side.

Genesis 39:21 and the lord was with joseph, and he was mercy with him, and he gave him grace before his husband.

Genesis 39:22 the year was given in the hand of joseph, and all those who were in the inside, and everything there was.

Genesis 39:23 because the lord was with him, and whatever he, the lord, was in his hand, because the lord was with him, and whatever he possessed, the lord was in his hand.

Genesis 40:1 after these things, the governor of the king of egypt and who is belonging to their master, the king of egypt.

Genesis 40:2 so the pharaoh was districted on his household, on the wall and on the other side.

Genesis 40:3 he put them in the wall by the inside side, to the other side, to the place where joseph lived there.

Genesis 40:4 and if joseph was districted to joseph, he was given to them. so they were a day in the wall.

Genesis 40:5 then i saw a drunk of a drunch. it was a droom in each side of his district, the year and the district of the king of egypt, who were in the inside side.

Genesis 40:6 when joseph came to them the morgon, he saw them, and they were something.

Genesis 40:7 and in the residence of pharaoh, who were with him in the mountain, in the house of his master, saying, " why is to this day what is about you ? "

Genesis 40:8 they said to him, " they have a drunks, but there is no food for him. " joseph said to them, " is it not by god or is it for them ? is it for me. "

Genesis 40:9 now the one of the thousand was his traom to joseph, and he said, " in my direction, it is in my presence in my presence.

Genesis 40:10 on the earthly side, there was three thousand, and it was in the district of the district of the wall.

Genesis 40:11 the clock of pharaoh was in my hand, and when i took it in the other side, i gave it into pharaoh ' s hand.

Genesis 40:12 joseph said to him, " this is his devotion : the three tages are three days.

Genesis 40:13 as for three days, when pharaoh is about three days, you will put you on your household, and you will give the servant of pharaoh in his hand, as it is about a thousand of thousand.

Genesis 40:14 but if it is good for me, if it is good to you, show mercy to me and think about me to pharaoh, but if it is in this way,

Genesis 40:15 for indeed, i have done nothing from the country of the earth, but from here i did not do anything except one of these gifts.

Genesis 40:16 when the evening saw that it was evening, he said to joseph, " i also saw a droom, and i saw three coins on my head.

Genesis 40:17 it was in the superior korb with every different service of the king of pharaoh, and the outside of the sky it will bear them from the clock on the head of my head.

Genesis 40:18 joseph replied, " this is his devotion : the three cors are three days.

Genesis 40:19 as three days, pharaoh will lead your head from you and put you on the clothing, and it will eat your gifts from you in the direction of the sky.

Genesis 40:20 at the next day, as a different day, happened to pharaoh, as well as for all his household, and in the district of the district of it is in the middle of his household.

Genesis 40:21 and evening of the clothing was on his household, and he gave it to pharaoh ' s hand.

Genesis 40:22 and to the district, according to the order of joseph.

Genesis 40:23 ( for the guard of joseph was not for him, but was about him.

Genesis 41:1 after two years, pharaoh saw a train in the other side of the river.

Genesis 41:2 now just as it was from the river, there was a district of seven thousand, in each side of the wall, in the district of the wall.

Genesis 41:3 after them, there will be seventy years after them, from the river, in the other side of the river, in the other side of the river, in the other side of the river.

Genesis 41:4 and in the number of the seven thousand, in the district of the wall, are the seven backs in the inside side and the wall of the wall of pharaoh.

Genesis 41:5 and on the second time, there was seven thousand in each side, in each side, in each side.

Genesis 41:6 , after them, there will be seven thousand of thousand and in the region after them.

Genesis 41:7 and in the number of the seven thousand, who were in high, and in the number of the seven thousand, who were in the region, and for pharaoh was a droom.

Genesis 41:8 the morning, when it appeared, he called all the people of egypt and all who are in it. so pharaoh gave them his droom, but there was no one who could give pharaoh.

Genesis 41:9 the governor said to pharaoh, " this very day my sins ! "

Genesis 41:10 for pharaon, to his household, he put us in the household of the household of it, both me and the year.

Genesis 41:11 he was also a traom in one way, i and he, each one with his own traom.

Genesis 41:12 he was there with us. we are a certain servant with us. he is a servant of the district of the household.

Genesis 41:13 just as it was with us, so i happened to my clothing, but he was inside.

Genesis 41:14 so when pharaoh arrived, he called joseph, who was ahead of them from the wall and on the wall of them, and so he came to pharaoh.

Genesis 41:15 so pharaoh said to joseph, " it is a drunker, but there is no food for it. if it is about you, i will make you something.

Genesis 41:16 joseph replied to pharaoh, " the devotion of god is not like pharaoh ' s household.

Genesis 41:17 so pharaoh said to joseph, " in my devotion we are there in the other side of the river.

Genesis 41:18 and just as it was from the river, there was a number of seven thousand, in each side of the wall, in the inside side.

Genesis 41:19 now there are seven thousand inside them. in all the region of egypt i did not see anything in the entire region in all the region of egypt.

Genesis 41:20 ( now there are the seven thousand in the wall, and in the district of the seven cloaks in the year and district.

Genesis 41:21 so they came into their mouth, but they were not able to bear that they had entered their mouth, and they were like the district of the wall.

Genesis 41:22 and i saw again in my mountain, about seven thousand in each side, in each side and in the other.

Genesis 41:23 at that way there will be seven thousand of thousand and on each other of them.

Genesis 41:24 and in the number of the seven thousand, who were in high, and in the number of the seven powers, i said to those who were in it, but there was no one who suffered to me.

Genesis 41:25 joseph said to pharaoh, " the traom of pharaoh is one, and god is worthy for pharaoh.

Genesis 41:26 the seven thousand are seven years, and the seven years of the seven years are seven years. the droom is one.

Genesis 41:27 the seven powers that are ahead of them are seven years, and the seven thousand in the number will be seventy years.

Genesis 41:28 this is the message of pharaoh : what god is performed to pharaoh,

Genesis 41:29 " on all the region of egypt will come seven years.

Genesis 41:30 for two years after these things will come, in all the region of egypt, seventy years, it will be in the entire region in all the region of egypt.

Genesis 41:31 and there is no creature on the earth, from the other side of the other side, for it will be something something.

Genesis 41:32 about the year, the traom of pharaoh is to two times, for the affection that comes from god and that god is able to make it.

Genesis 41:33 now in the region of egypt there is something for a human journey in the land of egypt.

Genesis 41:34 so as in the seventh years of the region of pharaoh and of the officers of the country of egypt, in the seventh years.

Genesis 41:35 and in the number of all the good years of these a good years and all the things that is in pharaoh ' s hand, in the other towns in those towns.

Genesis 41:36 and the district of the district of the earth will be in the years of the seven years in egypt, so that the earth will not be given by hunger.

Genesis 41:37 thus it was done before pharaoh and before all his companions.

Genesis 41:38 so pharaoh said to his companions, " it is not for a man so that the spirit of god is in him,

Genesis 41:39 so pharaoh said to joseph, " god is suffering to you all these things. there is no one who is in high or in your divisions.

Genesis 41:40 you will be over my house, and the whole one of my people will be in your command, except those who are with you.

Genesis 41:41 so pharaoh said to joseph, " look, you are today over all the region of egypt.

Genesis 41:42 so when pharaoh lived his clock from his hand, it was in joseph ' s hand, as it is in the wall of joseph.

Genesis 41:43 the wall of them was on the second side of his wall, who was directly before him, and the wall of them was over the entire region of egypt.

Genesis 41:44 so pharaoh said to joseph, " i am pharaoh among you ; you will not leave his hand on the whole egypt.

Genesis 41:45 so pharaoh named joseph to his wife, and he gave him a daughter, a daughter of his priest ' s priest, to his wife.

Genesis 41:46 joseph was thirty years when he stood before pharaoh, king of egypt. so joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and divided the whole egypt.

Genesis 41:47 and the earth was performed in the seven tages of the wall.

Genesis 41:48 in the number of the seven years in which it was in egypt, was abandoned. he placed in it in the towns of the towns of the city who was around it.

Genesis 41:49 so to joseph, like the hard of the sea, is something something like the hard of the sea, until it is districted, for it is not in it.

Genesis 41:50 before the years years were arrived, joseph became two sons to joseph.

Genesis 41:51 so joseph named the one of the one manasseh, because god made me toward all my possessions and all the family of my father. "

Genesis 41:52 ( now the name of the one is ephraim ), because god spoke me in my heavenly country.

Genesis 41:53 " now there are the seven years of it in the land of egypt.

Genesis 41:54 now in the number of the seven years of the year, just as joseph said, and there was something in all the regions, but in all the region of egypt were there.

Genesis 41:55 then the whole egypt of egypt, while the people were toward pharaoh for bread, pharaoh said to all his officers, " to joseph, " and whatever he says to you,

Genesis 41:56 and the one who was suffering on the face of the whole earth, joseph, who was in the region, and to all who were there.

Genesis 41:57 and all the believers who came to egypt with joseph, for there was the one who is in the entire earth.

Genesis 42:1 when jacob saw that there was there in egypt, he said to his sons, " why is it ? "

Genesis 42:2 look, there is in egypt there that there is something something in egypt.

Genesis 42:3 now a thousand of joseph, joseph ' s brothers, was eventy-two from egypt.

Genesis 42:4 but he did not send benjamin, the brother of joseph, with his brothers, because he asked that he could be done for him.

Genesis 42:5 so the israelites came along with the officers, because it was in the land of canaan.

Genesis 42:6 now joseph was the ruler of the earth, as it was about all the people of the land. but joseph ' s brothers came to them with his face to the ground.

Genesis 42:7 when joseph saw his fellow countrymen and some of them, he began to speak to them, and said to them, " where are they ? " they replied, " it is from the land of canaan. "

Genesis 42:8 so joseph departed his brothers, but they did not be with them.

Genesis 42:9 when joseph gathered the droom they had seen, he said to them, " you are in the side of the wall of the wall.

Genesis 42:10 they replied, " no, my lord, your servants are in high household.

Genesis 42:11 all the others are the sons of one man. they are not along with your servants.

Genesis 42:12 but he said to them, " not, but they will see the inside of the earth.

Genesis 42:13 they replied, " your servants are twelve thousand brothers and sisters in the land of canaan, and look, the one who is today with our father, but there is no one. "

Genesis 42:14 joseph said to them, " this is what he happens to you, saying, ' you are equal ! "

Genesis 42:15 this is the suffering of pharaoh : it will not be different, unless your brother who is in the evening, come here.

Genesis 42:16 there is one of you who should take the one of you and take your brother, but you are along, until your words - whether it is, or not. so as i lives pharaoh ' s service, you are always. "

Genesis 42:17 so he put them in charge for three days.

Genesis 42:18 on this earthly day he said to them, " however, i am guilty of god.

Genesis 42:19 if you are difficult, you are one of you in the district of the wall, while they are in the other side.

Genesis 42:20 and even your fellow fellow christian is suffering to me, and so is your words. if not, it is done. " so they did.

Genesis 42:21 then they said to each other, " just, it is in account of sin against our brother, since he experienced the suffering of his life when he is as us, but it is not with him. for this reason this way is against us.

Genesis 42:22 ruben answered them, " i did not say to you, ' is it not like the child, and it is not to me. look, his blood is always. "

Genesis 42:23 but they should not experience joseph, because he is suffering among them.

Genesis 42:24 now when joseph of them was toward joseph, he went to them again, and he spoke to them. then he took the year from them and brought it in their presence.

Genesis 42:25 joseph said to them, " each of them is different, and the money of the silver coins were in his moundation, and he was given to them on the way. so they happened.

Genesis 42:26 and on the district of the clothing, it is divided from there.

Genesis 42:27 in the same way, one of his companions, wanted to give something to it. he did not see his money of his money, and it was on the side of the other.

Genesis 42:28 he said to his guards, " something for me is the silver, and look, this is in my mountain, and their heart is toward me, and they say to one another, " what has god done for us ? "

Genesis 42:29 so they came to their father jacob into the land of canaan, and all they possessed to them were, saying :

Genesis 42:30 in the same way, the man who is the lord of the land, is with us, and he put us in the district of the district of the clothing.

Genesis 42:31 he will be districted to him, since it does not be districted.

Genesis 42:32 there is twelve brothers and sisters of our father. the one is not there, and the one who is today with our father is in the land of canaan.

Genesis 42:33 " the man who is the owner of the land said to us in this way : " you are equal, one of your brothers, there is with me, but on the other side of your house.

Genesis 42:34 so you think to me your evening of your fellow christian, because it is not toward you, because you are different, and if it is of your brother, it is with you and in the country of the earth.

Genesis 42:35 as they and their father and the money of the silver coins were in the inside of them, they saw the money of their silver coins, they and their father and their father.

Genesis 42:36 their father jacob said to them, " it is me, joseph ! there is no destruction there, and all these things were on benjamin against me.

Genesis 42:37 then ruben said to his father, " my two sons, unless they are to you, give him in my hand, and i will be with you. "

Genesis 42:38 but he said, " my son is not with you, because his brother has died, and he himself is alone, and each one of them is in the way i should be.

Genesis 43:1 the one who is in high regionity is in the earth.

Genesis 43:2 now when the thousand of the wells that they had brought from egypt, their father said to them, " let us again be a district of thousand.

Genesis 43:3 then judah said to him, " the man is impossible for us, saying, ' i will not look for me unless your brother is with you.

Genesis 43:4 if our brother is a different of our brothers with us, if it is something with us,

Genesis 43:5 but if our brother is not with us, it is not, for the man said to us, ' i will not have my face unless my brother is with you. '

Genesis 43:6 israel said, " what should i think with the man if you have a brother ? "

Genesis 43:7 they replied, " is the man to suffering us and our descendants, saying, ' your father is still alive ? you have a brother, and you have it like this ? is it no longer to say to us of some of your brothers ? '

Genesis 43:8 then judah said to his father israel, " the child is with me and is something with me, so that it may be something, and if there is neither we or you or our devotion.

Genesis 43:9 but i, if it is not one of them from my hand, if it is not to you, and if it is in your presence, i will continue to you always.

Genesis 43:10 if it would not be to us for two times,

Genesis 43:11 then israel their father said to them, " if this is like this, take some of the fruit of the land in your household, and to the man is like a offering of thousand, in the year, in it, and in something,

Genesis 43:12 and take the money in your hands, so that the silver, that is in your inside of you, is with you, for it is impossible.

Genesis 43:13 take your brother and gift to the man.

Genesis 43:14 and may the all-powerful god give you grace in the presence of the man and to the one of your other brothers and benjamin.

Genesis 43:15 so the men threw this gift, and the silver, that they had received in their hand, even benjamin and the inside of them to egypt. so they stood before joseph.

Genesis 43:16 when joseph saw benjamin with them, he said to his master ' s fellow officer, and said to the officer of his house, " these people will be in the house with me.

Genesis 43:17 so the man done just as joseph had said, and he put the men to joseph ' s house.

Genesis 43:18 when the men saw that it was in the house of joseph, they said, " because of the silver ground that are in our district of the district of our countryside, because of the district of the silver courts, ourselves and our officers. "

Genesis 43:19 when they came to the man who was over the house of joseph, they spoke to him in the wall of the house,

Genesis 43:20 " either, my lord, just as it is in the district of the region.

Genesis 43:21 now when it was in the district of the other side and in the number of our officers, it is now in our hand the money of our silver, our silver count is now in our hand.

Genesis 43:22 thus there is a other silver money with himself, so that there is no one who lives the money into our powers.

Genesis 43:23 so he said to them, " it is to you, that your god and the god of your father has given you in your household, and your money is in it. " so he brought the year to them.

Genesis 43:24 he brought their feet in the water, and gave it to their divisions.

Genesis 43:25 now the offering of the offering until joseph arrived, for they had heard that it was there.

Genesis 43:26 when joseph entered the house, he gave him the gifts that they had in their hands, and threw it down with his face to the ground.

Genesis 43:27 then he said to them, " is your father, the one about whom you said, is he again ? he lives again ? "

Genesis 43:28 they replied, " your servant our father is still living, he lives again ! " he replied, " that man is suffering to god, and if it is according to him. "

Genesis 43:29 when joseph looked up, he saw benjamin his fellow brother benjamin and said, " this is your brother who is the one about whom you said to me ? " he replied, " it is your son, my son ! "

Genesis 43:30 so joseph, as long as it was toward his clothing, he was to it. so he entered the district of the journey there.

Genesis 43:31 he went his face and went outside, and said, " five loaves ! "

Genesis 43:32 it is there alone with him, and for them apart, and to those who were with him apart, for the one who is with him is not in order with the seventy bread, for it is different for those who are with him.

Genesis 43:33 it is in his presence the first person according to his devotion, and the one who is according to his household, so that each one of the men was in the way of each other.

Genesis 43:34 so they threw something from him to them, because the family of benjamin was already beyond all of them, although he was with him, he also was there with him.

Genesis 44:1 so joseph gave this order to the officer of his house, saying, " it is suffering to those who are difficult of people, and the silver coins will be in the year of the other.

Genesis 44:2 and the district of me in the district of the wall of the district of the inside side, and it was according to the message that joseph promised.

Genesis 44:3 the next day, in the next day, there were the men with their divisions.

Genesis 44:4 they were not far along the city, but joseph said to the owner of his house, " follow the men and take them. then tell them, ' why do you take evil for good ? '

Genesis 44:5 why is this, in which my owner is something ? is it not that my master is in which my lord is ? for in it i will spend anything evil as it is.

Genesis 44:6 when he found them, he told them these words.

Genesis 44:7 so they said to him, " why does your lord be like these words ? is it not for your companions to do such things ?

Genesis 44:8 if the silver, which is in our household, is coming to you from the land of canaan, how can it find silver or gold from your master ' s house ?

Genesis 44:9 if it finds something of the clothing of your powers will be different, and we are ancestors of our lord.

Genesis 44:10 he said, " now the man on whom it finds will become my servant, and if it finds it, he will be my servant, but you will be in one. "

Genesis 44:11 suddenly, each of them will spend each one of them to the ground, each one of them, each of them.

Genesis 44:12 after he came from the wall until he came to the district of the wall, he found it in the district of the region of benjamin.

Genesis 44:13 so they threw their cloaks, each one of them, each one on his eselin. so they went in the city.

Genesis 44:14 so judas and his brothers came to the son of joseph while he was still there, and they stood before him to the ground.

Genesis 44:15 joseph said to them, " what is this for what it is ? it is not toward that a person is different as i am.

Genesis 44:16 then judah said, " what is it for our lord ? what is it, or what is it ? " but god found the offering of your offering. look, it is just like our lord, both we or the man on whom it is found.

Genesis 44:17 but joseph said, " i do not do me to do this. the man on whom it has found it will be my servant, but you will be always to your father.

Genesis 44:18 judas said to him, " either, my lord, your servant is like a order in your presence, and do not be done with your devotion, because you are like pharaoh.

Genesis 44:19 " lord, you are the servant of you, saying, ' have you father or brother ? '

Genesis 44:20 now we have a father for the lord, for we have a father of thousand, and a child difficult for him. his brother is died, but he is only in his household, but their father is different.

Genesis 44:21 now in the middle of you you will come to me, as well as you, and in his way.

Genesis 44:22 and if the child is not suffering to the lord, it is not suffering to his father, if she is suffering to his father,

Genesis 44:23 but if your brother who is with you, it will not be able to see me again unless your brother is with you.

Genesis 44:24 when it was evening with your father, our father, i brought to him the words of your lord.

Genesis 44:25 and our father said to us again, whether we have a district of thousand,

Genesis 44:26 but we will not be different with us, but if our brother who is with us, it is going to see the man ' s face, if our brother who is with us, it is not going to see the man ' s face.

Genesis 44:27 " your servant our father said to us, " you will have two sons whose wife given to me.

Genesis 44:28 the one went out from me, and i said, ' he was suffering, and i have not seen him until now.

Genesis 44:29 if you also take this man from my presence, i will find it always on the way, and if it is in my way, i will be with them to the hades.

Genesis 44:30 now if it is in the way with your father, our father, and if the child is not with us, but his life is different from this person,

Genesis 44:31 when he saw that the child is not with us, then your servants were with us, when we see that the child is not with us, and if you see that the child is not with us,

Genesis 44:32 for your servant is like the child from his father, saying, ' if the child is not like you, i will remain to his father always.

Genesis 44:33 so then, your servant is something for the sake of your lord, but the child is with your brothers.

Genesis 44:34 how can i be suffering to the father of the one who is with me, so that i may not see the evil things that is about my father.

Genesis 45:1 so joseph would not be beyond all what he possessed to him, but he said, " reject all things away from me, and there will no longer be something to joseph when he happened to it.

Genesis 45:2 there was a large voice with them, and when all the officions were heard, they happened to pharaoh ' s house.

Genesis 45:3 then joseph said to his brothers, " i am joseph ! is my father still alive ?

Genesis 45:4 then joseph said to his brothers, " look at me and come to me. " and he said, " i am joseph, your brother who is in egypt.

Genesis 45:5 now now, no longer of you, since god has sent me before you for life for life.

Genesis 45:6 for there is a second years in the earth, and there is still about five years that there will not be something or something.

Genesis 45:7 god has sent me before you. in once of you, in the earth, god will send me before you.

Genesis 45:8 now now you are not here with me here but god, who made me a father of pharaoh, lord over all his house and in the region of all the land of egypt.

Genesis 45:9 i will be suffering to my father and tell him, ' this is the solemn pronouncement of your son joseph : god has made me lord over all the land of egypt.

Genesis 45:10 you will be in a suffering country, you will be near me, you, your sons, your children ' s children, your sheep, your clothing, and everything you have.

Genesis 45:11 you will spend you there, for it is still for five years, so not you, your sons, and everything you possess.

Genesis 45:12 look, your eyes and my brother benjamin ' s eyes are like you, because my devoted mouth is to you.

Genesis 45:13 so i will give my father all my glory in egypt, and whatever is, and whatever it is, to my father.

Genesis 45:14 on the region of his brother benjamin was ahead of him, but benjamin on his clothing.

Genesis 45:15 he was among them all his brothers and sisters, and after these things his brothers spoke to him.

Genesis 45:16 now in the house of pharaoh was this voice : " joseph ' s brothers are different, but it is for pharaoh and his companions.

Genesis 45:17 then pharaoh said to joseph, " tell your fellow countrymen that it will be toward you, and come to the land of canaan.

Genesis 45:18 i will bear your father and your divisions to me, and i will give you all the good things of egypt and the divisions of the earth.

Genesis 45:19 so you will be different with them in the land of egypt, for your household, in your household, and in the district of your father.

Genesis 45:20 it must not be difficult for your ancestors, for everything good of egypt will be your.

Genesis 45:21 so the sons of israel did so. joseph gave them according to the order of pharaoh, and gave them something to the way.

Genesis 45:22 to each of them he will give it something to it, but to benjamin he will give a district of thousand, and for five thousand.

Genesis 45:23 and to his father he sent four thousand of all the good places of egypt, and twenty thousand bread for his father for the way.

Genesis 45:24 so he sent his brothers and went away. he said to them, " let them not be on the way.

Genesis 45:25 so they went up from egypt and came to their father jacob in the land of canaan.

Genesis 45:26 they were saying to him, " joseph is living, and he is in the region of all the land of egypt and the household of jacob, for there is nothing of them. "

Genesis 45:27 so they told him everything that joseph had given to them, and when he saw the waves joseph had sent, so that in their wall there was the spirit of jacob their father,

Genesis 45:28 israel said, " it is great ! joseph my son is still alive before them before i live. "

Genesis 46:1 so israel accompanied with everything he possessed, and he came to the other side of the wall, and offered offering to the god of his father isaac.

Genesis 46:2 and god said to israel in the night of the night, " jacob, jacob ! " he replied, " here i am. "

Genesis 46:3 " i am the god of your father. do not be afraid to egypt, for there i will make you a great nation. '

Genesis 46:4 so i will be with you to egypt, and i will be with you for all times, and joseph will put his hands on your eyes. "

Genesis 46:5 so jacob got up from the wall of the year, and the people of israel accompanied their father david, their father, and their wives at the wells that joseph had sent to take him.

Genesis 46:6 so moses and all his descendants in the region of the land of canaan, they went into egypt, jacob and all his descendants with him.

Genesis 46:7 he brought his daughters and his sons and his daughters and his daughters and his entire descendants he brought with him to egypt.

Genesis 46:8 these are the name of the descendants of israel in egypt : jacob and his sons. the descendant of jacob, ruben.

Genesis 46:19 the sons of jacob, the wife of jacob, were joseph and benjamin.

Genesis 46:20 now the sons of joseph were in egypt, which the son had given to him, in the land of egypt : manasseh and ephraim. ) now the sons of manasseh who the araman people were given to him. ( now the sons of ephraim, the brother of manasseh, were two and thousand.

Genesis 46:26 all the divisions that were with jacob in egypt, who were in his household, except the relatives of the sons of jacob, a number of seventy-six.

Genesis 46:27 and the sons of joseph who were given to him in egypt in the region of all the familes of the house of jacob who were in egypt, were seventy-five.

Genesis 46:28 so he sent judas before him to joseph. it was in the wilderness of a town to a district country.

Genesis 46:29 when joseph recognized his gifts, he went up to incontro to his father israel, in each of the towns of the town.

Genesis 46:30 israel said to joseph, " from now on you will think your face for you, because you are still alive.

Genesis 46:31 then joseph said to his brothers and to the family of his fellow countrymen, i will say to him, " my brothers and my father, who were in the land of canaan, were with me.

Genesis 46:32 but these men are different, for they are any husbands, their sheep, their sheep, and all their possessions.

Genesis 46:33 if pharaoh allows you and says, ' what is your work ? '

Genesis 46:34 you and our ancestors, in the wilderness, are your servants in the wilderness to now, and we and our ancestors, so that they will be in a wilderly land, for there is something for every sheep of sheep.

Genesis 47:1 so joseph came to pharaoh and said, " my father and my brothers came from the land of canaan with their beast, their beast, and everything they have, have come from the land of canaan, and look, they are in the country of sear. "

Genesis 47:2 from of his brothers, two men, he presented them before pharaoh.

Genesis 47:3 so pharaoh said to the men of joseph, " what is your work ? " they replied to pharaoh, " your servants are two sheep, both we or our ancestors. "

Genesis 47:4 so they said to pharaoh, " we have come along in the land, for there is no passion for those who are in your household, because it is in the land of canaan. now now may your servants be now in the wilderness. "

Genesis 47:5 then pharaoh said to the wilderness, in the wilderness, " if they think there are some people in number of them, they will come to egypt to joseph. when pharaoh, the king of egypt, heard this, he said to joseph, " your father and your brothers are with you. "

Genesis 47:6 look, the land of egypt is before you. in the countryside you will make your father and your brothers.

Genesis 47:7 so joseph brought his father jacob and presented him before pharaoh. so jacob blessed pharaoh.

Genesis 47:8 so pharaoh said to jacob, " you are two years of the days of your life.

Genesis 47:9 so jacob said to pharaoh, " the days of the years of my life, a hundred thirty years, and the days of the years of my life will not be experienced in the days of the years of my ancestors as long as i live.

Genesis 47:10 so jacob died pharaon and went out from him.

Genesis 47:11 and he gave his father joseph and his brothers and gave them in the land of egypt, in the wilderness of the country, in the land, just as pharaoh had commanded.

Genesis 47:12 to joseph, his father, his companions, and all his father ' s family, according to the body.

Genesis 47:13 now in the entire region there was no something in all the country, because the land of egypt and the land of canaan were in it.

Genesis 47:14 so joseph turned in the house of pharaoh all the money that was in egypt and in the land of canaan. it was in the number of them, and joseph, all the money, was in the house of pharaoh.

Genesis 47:15 when all the silver coins were coming in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan, and all the officers came to joseph and said, " give us bread, why are it in your presence, because our money is toward you ? "

Genesis 47:16 joseph said to them, " just as you are, i will give you bread for your feet, whether it is silver. "

Genesis 47:17 so they brought their beast to joseph, and joseph gave them bread for the horses, for the sheep, for the hors, for the hors, for the eseep, and for the eseep.

Genesis 47:18 when that year came, they came to him at the earthly year, and said to him, " it is not to bear from my master, if the silver, it, and his beast, is different to you in the presence of our lord except the body and our land.

Genesis 47:19 so that we, we and our land, will not be in your presence for your presence, us and our land for bread, and we and our land are pharaon ' s slaves. give children, so that it may be different and sive, and that the earth should not be in it.

Genesis 47:20 so joseph gathered the whole land that was for pharaoh, for those who spend their land is for pharaoh because the food of their divisions is to pharaoh. so the land became pharaoh.

Genesis 47:21 and he will make the number of the people, from the east of egypt to the other.

Genesis 47:22 but there is not only joseph of the country of the priests, for he has given a gift to pharaoh ' s household, and for all the tradition pharaoh has given them. therefore it does not bear their land.

Genesis 47:23 then joseph said to all the people, " look, you and your land is today for pharaoh. look, take children and divided the land.

Genesis 47:24 the district of the clothing of it will be for pharaoh, and the fellowship will be for you for the descendance of the earth, so that it will be different for you and for all who live in your household.

Genesis 47:25 and said, " let us experience grace before our lord and deacons of pharaoh ' s servants.

Genesis 47:26 so joseph divided them in the country of egypt until this day. except the country of the priests did not be for pharaoh.

Genesis 47:27 so when israel was along in the land of egypt, in the inside of the land, and it was in it.

Genesis 47:28 so jacob was in egypt for seven years. so the days of jacob, in the day of his life, were about hundred and firty-seven years.

Genesis 47:29 when israel experienced the evening of israel, he called his son joseph and said to him, " if you have in your eyes gun-giving gunnment, let you put your hand under my household, and make on me justice and truth, so that i will not take me in egypt.

Genesis 47:30 but you will be suffering with my ancestors. then you will remove me from egypt and make me in their wall. " and he said, " i will do as you said. "

Genesis 47:31 so he said to me, " so he swored to him. so he swore to him, and with all the people of israel.

Genesis 48:1 after these things, joseph was toward joseph, saying, " your father is different. " so he went to jacob his two sons, manasseh and ephraim.

Genesis 48:2 they said to jacob, " look, your son joseph comes to you. " and the whole israel stood on the wall.

Genesis 48:3 then jacob said to joseph, " my god is with me in the regions of the region of canaan, and blessed me

Genesis 48:4 he said to me, ' look, i will spend you and make you down, and i will make you in high nations, and i will give you this land and your foundation after you to ever.

Genesis 48:5 now now your two sons who bear you in the land of egypt before i come to you in egypt, are mine. efraim and manasseh will be mine like ruben, and some will be mine.

Genesis 48:6 the other things that will be after them, will be your, in the name of their brothers, in those where they live.

Genesis 48:7 but whenever i am suffering from the region of the syria, your mother was died in the land of canaan, in the extrem of the earth, so that they will come as long as it is in the way of her.

Genesis 48:8 when israel saw the sons of joseph, he asked, " who are these ? "

Genesis 48:9 joseph said to his father, " they are my sons whom god has given me something. " jacob replied, " give me them to bear them. "

Genesis 48:10 so the eyes of israel were different from the wall, so that it would not be different. so i brought them to him, so that he could arrest them, so that they could spend them.

Genesis 48:11 so israel said to joseph, " look, i don ' t look at your face, and look, god is with me and your descendants.

Genesis 48:12 so joseph led them out from his mountain and put them down with his face to the ground.

Genesis 48:13 so joseph took his two sons, ephraim in his right hand from the district of israel, but manasse in the wilderness at the right hand of israel, i brought them to him.

Genesis 48:14 so israel threw his covering hand on the head of ephraim, who was in the way, and the clothing of it was on the head of manasseh.

Genesis 48:15 and he blessed them and said, " the god in his presence my ancestors abraham and isaac, the god who walked me from the mountain until this day,

Genesis 48:16 the angel who gathered me from all the evil things that are about these things, and in them think my name and the name of my ancestors abraham, isaac, and gath, a great multitude on the earth.

Genesis 48:17 now when joseph saw that his father was toward the head of ephraim, it will be in his household. and when joseph lived his father ' s hand, it was from the head of ephraim on the head of manasseh.

Genesis 48:18 so joseph said to his father, " not so, father, for this is the one who lives your cloak on his head.

Genesis 48:19 he will not be anything. he said, " i know, my son, i know. this man will become a people, and so is it. his fellow brother will be in his household, and his descendants will become a large nations.

Genesis 48:20 so he blessed them at that day, saying, " among you is the people of israel, saying, ' god make you like ephraim and manasseh ! " so he put ephraim before manasseh.

Genesis 48:21 so israel said to joseph, " look, i am with you, and god will be with you, and i will put you into your ancestors ' s land.

Genesis 48:22 and i will give you greater than your brothers, which i received with my sword and with my sword from the hand of the amoreens. "

Genesis 49:1 so jacob called his sons and said to him, " let you find what you are in some days.

Genesis 49:2 " just as you hear this, you sons of jacob, listen to your father israel !

Genesis 49:3 ruben, you are my gent.you are my strength, my power and the beginning of my child.

Genesis 49:4 it is like the watering water, for it is not difficult in the household of your father.

Genesis 49:5 from the country of them there there is levi and levi.

Genesis 49:6 do not be in their conscience, my soul, do not be in their constance. for in the district of them, there is seventy people in their divisions.

Genesis 49:7 in the same way their anger, because their wrath is difficult, because i am revealed them in jacob. so that it was in israel.

Genesis 49:8 you, judah, you are your brothers and your brothers. your hand will be against the people of your enemies, with you, the sons of your father.

Genesis 49:9 in the region of judah, my son, in the district of the region, like a lew, like a lew as each of them.

Genesis 49:10 there will not be a ruling reign from judah and of it, until it comes what is in it, and he is the district of the nations.

Genesis 49:11 in the district of his district, in the district of his district, in the district of his wall, and in the district of the clothing.

Genesis 49:12 his eyes are difficult of wine, and his clothes are full of much.

Genesis 49:13 it will be different, and he will be on the district of the other side to the seventy.

Genesis 49:14 it is what is good for good among the clothing.

Genesis 49:15 when he saw that it was good and the earth was good, he put his sword on the other side, and it became a different man.

Genesis 49:16 dan will judge his own people like one of the people of israel.

Genesis 49:17 a district of dan was a district on the journey, on the wall of the other side, and on the other side on the other side.

Genesis 49:18 it is the salvation of the lord.

Genesis 49:19 gad is ahead of them, but he is in their feet.

Genesis 49:20 asser, his relative food, and he will give it inside.

Genesis 49:21 in the district of the inside side, there is it.

Genesis 49:22 the son of jeus, joseph, the son of joneah, my son, who was suffering to me.

Genesis 49:23 we will be suffering to it, and it will be in a district of thousand.

Genesis 49:24 now in the wall of jacob, the district of israel, is in the household of jacob, from there is the chief of israel.

Genesis 49:25 from the god of your father, and it will give you.

Genesis 49:26 " in the same way, it will be on your father and your mother on the high mountain, and they will be on the head of joseph and on the other brothers of your brothers.

Genesis 49:27 benjamin will be difficult for his household again, and to the evening at the evening.

Genesis 49:28 these are all twelve things of jacob, and these things their father said to them, and blessed each one according to his desire.

Genesis 49:29 he said to them, " i am with my people, because i am in high way with my ancestors, i am with my ancestors.

Genesis 49:30 in the district of the superior wall, in the region of the region, in the region of canaan, in the district of the wall, in the district of the wall.

Genesis 49:31 there is abraham and his wife there, where isaac and his wife was, where isaac and his wife was.

Genesis 49:32 in the wilderness of the field and the mountain that is there, from the sons of heth.

Genesis 49:33 so he will be suffering to jacob for his sons, and he will spend his feet at the wall of the wall and to the other, to his people.

Genesis 50:1 so joseph was suffering on his father ' s face, on the head of his father.

Genesis 50:2 so joseph gave instruction to his servants who was according to his father, and to the officers of israel.

Genesis 50:3 and ahead of him were firty days, for in this way the days of the year and wall of them were two and seventy-days.

Genesis 50:5 my father was in a way to me, saying : ' in the district of the region in the land of canaan, i am there. for now is what i are for my father and already my father ? '

Genesis 50:6 so pharaoh said, " indeed, i will give you in order of your father. "

Genesis 50:7 so joseph went up to his father, and all the servants of pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of egypt were with him.

Genesis 50:8 and all the household of joseph and his brothers and all his husbands were in the country of the wilderness of joseph, his sheep, his sheep, and his sheep.

Genesis 50:10 in the district of the clothing that is on the other side of the jordan river, it is a great and difficulty. he made for his father moses seven days.

Genesis 50:11 when the inhabitants of the land, the kanaans, who were in the wall of the wall, said, " this is a great number of those who are, " for this reason they called it egypt, which is on the other side of the jordan river.

Genesis 50:12 so his sons did with them as as he had told them.

Genesis 50:13 his sons were ahead of him in the land of canaan, and in the district of the other side, in the wall of abraham, in the district of the wall, in the district of the wall.

Genesis 50:14 so joseph went to egypt with his brothers and sisters to egypt, he and his brothers and all the companions of his father.

Genesis 50:15 when joseph ' s brothers saw that their father was suffering, they said, " call joseph would be with us, and if he would give us all the evil things he are for him. "

Genesis 50:16 he appeared to joseph, saying, " your father is going before them, saying,

Genesis 50:17 " tell joseph, as long as you say to joseph, " you will give them the night and their transgression, because it is difficulty for you. but now is the district of the distriction of the god of your father and of joseph.

Genesis 50:18 when they came to him, they said, " we are something for you ? "

Genesis 50:19 but joseph said to them, " i am not for god.

Genesis 50:20 you are generous evil against me, but god is suffering for me in good, so that it may be just as it is today, so that it may be in high people.

Genesis 50:21 so then, he said to them, " i am not toward you and your husbands. when i arrive them, he spoke to their hearts.

Genesis 50:22 so joseph and his brothers and all the familes of his father were in egypt for 110 years.

Genesis 50:23 joseph saw the descendants of ephraim in the number of the generations, and the sons of gath, the son of manasseh, was in the number of joseph.

Genesis 50:24 then joseph said to his officers, " i am ahead of you, and i will bring you out of this land into the land that he swore to abraham, isaac, and jacob.

Genesis 50:25 so joseph permitted the people of israel, saying, " in the mountain god is going to you, i will spend my bears with you.

Genesis 50:26 when joseph was there, he was a food of 110 years, in the district of them, in the wall of egypt, and in the district of jacob, his sons, he will spend his feet on the wall and in the district of his people.

Exodus 1:1 these are the names of the sons of israel in egypt with jacob, each one with each of them.

Exodus 1:2 ruben, levi, judah.

Exodus 1:3 on israel and benjamin.

Exodus 1:4 dan, hagad, gad, asser,

Exodus 1:5 now joseph and joseph were seventy-five, but joseph was in egypt.

Exodus 1:6 so joseph and all his brothers and all that were there.

Exodus 1:7 now the people of israel were superior, thousand, and name, and they were greatly districted, and the land was toward them.

Exodus 1:8 so the king of israel stood up over egypt, who did not be joseph.

Exodus 1:9 then he said to his servant : " look, the number of the children of israel is great and greater than we are.

Exodus 1:10 indeed, if they think that we would not be something, or if there is something in a district, the other to the one who is along, and if we spend us along from the earth.

Exodus 1:11 these works were different for them to make them in the wall of the region, and in thousand towns, in the region of pharaoh, in the wall, in the district of elias,

Exodus 1:12 so in the journey of the people of israel, they will spend them in a district of thousand and district, so many of the people of israel.

Exodus 1:13 and it will be difficulty for the people of israel.

Exodus 1:14 and their life will be in the district of the clothing, in the vineyard, in the wall, and for all those who are in the wilderness, in all their work that they will make.

Exodus 1:15 then the king said to the suffering of the clothing, to the one of them was jamel, and the other was the name of the other.

Exodus 1:16 and he said, " whenever it is something, they will be to the year, if it is something, if it is something, it is something.

Exodus 1:17 but in the appearance of god, they did not accomplite what the king of egypt had instructed with them, and what was on it.

Exodus 1:18 when the king of egypt called the officers, he said to them, " why is this doing, and what is it in it ? "

Exodus 1:19 the officers said to pharaoh, " it is not like the women of egypt, for it is not like it.

Exodus 1:20 it is good for god for the household of the household, and the people will be experienced, and they are experienced.

Exodus 1:21 because god is suffering, he made household of house for god.

Exodus 1:22 then pharaoh gave this order to all his people, saying, " whatever on it is, to the wall of the wall, and everything that is in it.

Exodus 2:1 now a man from the tribe of levi went and took birth of a daughter of levi.

Exodus 2:2 immediately she gave birth and gave birth to a child. when she saw him in the wall of his household, she gave him three months.

Exodus 2:3 if he was no longer, his mother took him something, so that the child was in it. when the child was in her, she put her in the district of the clothing.

Exodus 2:4 however, his sister was in the constance of what he had.

Exodus 2:5 so pharaoh ' s daughter came to one on the district of the wall.

Exodus 2:6 when he saw a child in the wilderness, there was a child. with him was the daughter of pharaoh, and there was some of these little children.

Exodus 2:7 his sister said to pharaoh ' s household, " do you give you a wife in the wall of the women, and you will be given the child. "

Exodus 2:8 the daughter of pharaoh said to her, " whenever it is, she called his husband ' s mother.

Exodus 2:9 the daughter of pharaoh said to her, " this child is for me, and i will give it to you. " so the woman took the child and gave it.

Exodus 2:10 aaron ' s daughter was in his household, to the daughter of pharaoh, and she became his son. to him was moses ' s name moses.

Exodus 2:11 at that time moses was great, he went out to his brothers, the people of israel, and in the journey of their divisions, he saw a man according to some of his own brothers.

Exodus 2:12 where there and here is there, there is no longer to see, and in the wall of the wall of them, in the wilderness.

Exodus 2:13 the next day he went out two men by it, and he said to his one, " why do you make your neighbor ? "

Exodus 2:14 so he said, " who is you suffering to you, and you are against us ? do not be you to do just as it is in the district of the clothing ? " moses said, " if it is so, it is beyond this. "

Exodus 2:15 when pharaoh heard this, moses was instructed. but moses was going from the presence of pharaoh and was in the land of midian. when he came to the land of midian, he sat on the wall.

Exodus 2:16 now in the district of midian were seven daughters. they were for their father ' s sheep in the district of their father, the sheep of their father.

Exodus 2:17 now when those who were ahead of them, moses stood up to them, as they were with them, and with their sheep.

Exodus 2:18 and when they came to their father, jamon, he asked them, " why is it between this very day ? "

Exodus 2:19 they replied, " if a man is suffering on us from the clothing, it will be something for us and our sheep.

Exodus 2:20 " and where is he ? " he replied, " why is he ? why is he like a man to make him to eat ? "

Exodus 2:21 so moses was with the man, and he made his daughter to moses as a wife.

Exodus 2:22 in the same evening the woman gave birth to a son, and moses was named him always, saying, " i am in the wilderness. "

Exodus 2:23 after the evening of the journey, the king of egypt, was in order, and the people, because of the works, their divisions went up to god because of the works.

Exodus 2:24 and god will make the household of them, and god will make his covenant with abraham, isaac, and jacob.

Exodus 2:25 and god was permitted to the people of israel, so that they may be given them.

Exodus 3:1 now moses was ahead of the sheep by his household, the priest of midian. then he brought the sheep along the wilderness, and came to the mountain of sear.

Exodus 3:2 the angel of the lord appeared to him in the district of fire from the wall. and he saw that the one who was gathered with fire, but it does not be different.

Exodus 3:3 then moses said, " what is this great suffering, for what is it that it will not be different. "

Exodus 3:4 when the lord saw that he was about to see, god called him from the east, saying, moses, moses ! " he replied, " here me am ! "

Exodus 3:5 then he said, " there is no clothing there from your feet ! for the place where you are, is holy. "

Exodus 3:6 so he said to him, " i am the god of your father, the god of abraham, the god of isaac, and the god of jacob. "

Exodus 3:7 then the lord said to moses, " i have seen the direction of my people who are in egypt and the district of them in the wall of them, for i know their divisions.

Exodus 3:8 i will reject them from man ' s hand, and i will spend them from the earth, so that i will spend them in a different and different land, in a district of mill and honey, in the district of the wilderness, in the year, to the amoreer, as well as it is.

Exodus 3:9 now look, the one of the people of israel has come to me, and i, in order of the powers that are about them,

Exodus 3:10 so come now and bring you to pharaoh, and make my people, the children of israel, from egypt. "

Exodus 3:11 but moses said to god, " who am i that i will come to pharaoh and to give the israelites out of egypt ? "

Exodus 3:12 and god said, " i will be with you. and this will be your sign that i will be you when you put the people out of egypt and is there for god on this mountain.

Exodus 3:13 then moses said to god, " look, i am coming to the israelites, and i will say to them, ' if the god of your ancestors would not be with you, why is his name ? what should i say to them ? "

Exodus 3:14 then god said to moses, " i am the one who am. " and he said, " say to the people of israel, ' the one who is with you. "

Exodus 3:15 then god said to moses again, " say to the people of israel, ' the lord, the god of your ancestors, the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob,

Exodus 3:16 here, the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob, and tell them, ' the lord, the god of your ancestors, is like me, the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob, and said, ' i will leave you and whatever you have in egypt.

Exodus 3:17 then i said, " i will reject you from the district of thousand, into the region of us, in the district of the region, in the region, in the region, with milk and honey.

Exodus 3:18 just as you and the people of israel are ahead of your voice, you and the people of israel, to pharaoh, king of egypt, and say to him, ' the god of those who are in the region, we will be in the wilderness for three days to the wilderness to serve our god.

Exodus 3:19 i know that pharaoh, the king of egypt, will not allow you to be, except with a single hand.

Exodus 3:20 and i will remove his hand to them, to them who are in all my powers that i will make among them, and after these things i will spend you.

Exodus 3:21 and i will give this people favor before the household, but if it is in it, it will not be different.

Exodus 3:22 " there will be a wife from the district of his district and in the wall of it will be powers for your sons, your daughters and your husbands.

Exodus 4:1 moses answered, " even if it is not something with me or by my voice, for they will say, ' the lord is not to you. "

Exodus 4:2 so the lord said to him, " what is this in your hand ? " he replied, " however. "

Exodus 4:3 so moses said, " it is toward the land ! " so he threw it on the ground, but moses was suffering, and moses was toward moses.

Exodus 4:4 then the lord said to moses, " put your hand on the side of the wall, and make his hand on the side of the wall, so that it is suffering in his hand.

Exodus 4:5 " that it may be done for you that the lord, the god of their ancestors, the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob.

Exodus 4:6 then the lord said to him again, " again, you will put your hand into your home, and if he threw his hand from it, his hand is like it.

Exodus 4:7 then he said, " look again, look again, keep again your hand on your clothing, and think it out, as soon as it is.

Exodus 4:8 if there is no difficult of you or experienced the slander of the district of the district of the other side,

Exodus 4:9 if the water that comes from the river will be blood of blood of the river and of the other side on the other side, then the water that is from the river will become blood on the year.

Exodus 4:10 but moses said to the lord, "

Exodus 4:11 then the lord said to moses, " who has given the man ' s mouth ? who has done it. is not i the lord ?

Exodus 4:12 and now, in fact, i will be just as your mouth, and i will put you in charge of you.

Exodus 4:13 so moses said, " ag, lord, it is with you with others, which you are.

Exodus 4:14 then the anger of the lord appeared against moses, and he said, " is not aaron your brother who is ahead of you ? he is going out to incontro you, and when he sees you is in himself.

Exodus 4:15 you must speak to him, and you will put my words in his mouth, and i will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will give you what you should do.

Exodus 4:16 he will be something for you for the people. he will be your mouth, and you will be his god.

Exodus 4:17 and you will take this scroll in your hand, by which you will do the miraculous signs.

Exodus 4:18 so moses went and appeared to the officers of his officials, and said, " as long as it is in egypt with my brothers and sisters in egypt. if there is no longer, he said, " it is in the way of moses. "

Exodus 4:19 after the next day, the king of egypt, there was the king of egypt. then the lord said to moses in midian, in the journey in egypt, because all those who are about your life are about you.

Exodus 4:20 so moses accompanied his wife with their divisions, and returned to egypt. then moses took the devotion of god in his hand.

Exodus 4:21 then the lord said to moses, " just as you are going to egypt, see that you may do before pharaoh all the things i have given in your hand.

Exodus 4:22 you say to pharaoh, ' so says the lord : israel is my son of my household.

Exodus 4:23 and i said to you, ' it will be suffering to my people, so that they will be given to me. if it does not be suffering to them, so look, i will be with your year son. "

Exodus 4:24 on the way the angel of the lord was on the way on the way, and the angel of the lord was ahead of him.

Exodus 4:25 in the district of it, in the district of her son, is in the district of her son. " so she said, " you are a block of blood that is in the wall of me.

Exodus 4:26 so he left him, because she said, " you are a blood of blood that is in my mouth. "

Exodus 4:27 then the lord said to aaron, " each of them is to incontro to the wilderness. " so he went and placed it in the mountain of god in the mountain of god.

Exodus 4:28 moses brought to aaron all the words that the lord had sent, and all the miraculous signs he had commanded him.

Exodus 4:29 so moses and aaron and all the divisions of the people of israel went away.

Exodus 4:30 so aaron told all the things that the lord had spoken to moses, and he did the miraculous signs before the people.

Exodus 4:31 and when the people and the people think that god is powerful to the israelites, and that he has seen their direction, but the people were in high way.

Exodus 5:1 after this, moses and aaron went to pharaoh and said to him, " so says the lord, the god of israel, ' i will make my people to be in the wilderness.

Exodus 5:2 but pharaoh replied, " who is here, that is not by his voice ? so that it will bear the israelites. i do not know the lord, nor is it in israel. "

Exodus 5:3 so the god said to him, " however, god is suffering to us in the wilderness for three days to the wilderness to make us to the lord our god, if it may be something for us. "

Exodus 5:4 the king of egypt said to them, " moses and aaron, why are you going to the work of his work, moses and aaron ?

Exodus 5:5 then pharaoh said, " look ! now the people are in high way, but do not leave them from their works ! "

Exodus 5:6 so pharaoh gave this order to the officions of the people and to those who were before him, saying :

Exodus 5:7 there is no longer in the number of the people in the district of the district of the region, in the district of the district of each other.

Exodus 5:8 the wall of the wall of the wall, each day in every day, is nothing for them, for it is different, because they say, " it is guilty and something for our god.

Exodus 5:9 this is the works of these men, and happening these things, so that they will not be in the country of them.

Exodus 5:10 then the officers and the officers began to speak to the people, saying, " so says pharaoh : you will not be any longer.

Exodus 5:11 you will recognize yourselves in the way where you leave, for it will not be different from all of you.

Exodus 5:12 so the people were in the entire region in the entire region in the whole egypt.

Exodus 5:13 those who are ahead of them, thus they say, " you are recognized every day the work that is for you, and as it is something for you.

Exodus 5:14 and in the number of the officers of the gifts of the people of israel, who concerned them by the officers of pharaoh, thus they say, " why does it not be experienced in the number of thousand and seventy day and today ? "

Exodus 5:15 as long as the officers of the people of israel are devoted to pharaoh, saying, " why do it think with your husbands ?

Exodus 5:16 as much, they say to us : ' do it ! ' but look, your servants are in order for your people. "

Exodus 5:17 and he said, " watter you are ? for this reason you are a district for our god.

Exodus 5:18 so now, since it is different, it will not be different for you, even on the district of the wall.

Exodus 5:19 as long as the officers of the descendants of the people of israel are in order, saying, " it is not about the district of the district on the day.

Exodus 5:20 but as long as they were apart from pharaoh, they walked to moses and aaron.

Exodus 5:21 and said to them, " in the same way, the lord is suffering to you, even if it is suffering to us in the presence of pharaoh and of his companions, to give him a sword in his hand.

Exodus 5:22 then moses returned to the lord and said, " lord, why are it against this people ? why do you think me ?

Exodus 5:23 since it is suffering to pharaoh, it is toward your name suffering to this people, but you will not leave your people.

Exodus 6:1 then the lord said to moses, " i will already do what i will do to pharaoh, because he will put them in his hand, and i will put them down from his own country.

Exodus 6:2 god said to moses, " i am the lord.

Exodus 6:3 and there is for abraham, isaac, and jacob, the all-powerful god, but the name of the lord will not be given to them.

Exodus 6:4 and i will make my covenant with them to give them the land of horem, the land where we lived and where i live.

Exodus 6:5 and i will be different of the generations of the people of israel, who are in order with them, and along of your covenant.

Exodus 6:6 " tell the people of israel, ' i am the lord.

Exodus 6:7 i will make you to be my people, and i will be your god. and you will think that i am the lord your god, who lives you from the other side.

Exodus 6:8 i will put you into the land where i made my hand to give it to abraham, isaac, and jacob, and i will give it to you in the way. i am the lord.

Exodus 6:9 so moses said this to the people of israel, but moses was not in this way from the wall or from the opportunity.

Exodus 6:10 then the lord said to moses,

Exodus 6:11 " enter and tell pharaoh, the king of egypt, to give the people of israel out of his land. "

Exodus 6:12 but moses said to the lord, " look, the people of israel are not from me. how then is pharaoh with me, and i am there. "

Exodus 6:13 then the lord said to moses and aaron, and he commanded them to the people of israel from egypt.

Exodus 6:14 these are the families of their families : the descendants of ruben, in the region of israel, was in the number of israel.

Exodus 6:15 the sons of thuh : eesth, cisrah, hogmi, sohar, and saul, the son of gath. these were the descendants of the sons of her.

Exodus 6:16 these are the name of the sons of levi, according to their familes, in the region of the region, and the years of life of levi was 137 years.

Exodus 6:17 and these were the sons of thisar and shimei, in the region of them.

Exodus 6:18 the sons of thus was hosa, in the region of hebron and hosa, and the years of life was a hundred thirty years.

Exodus 6:19 the sons of merari : a son and some. these were the families of the familes of levi according to their familes.

Exodus 6:20 so he took sin, his father ' s daughter, as a wife, and he gave him aaron and moses. but the years of life was 132 years.

Exodus 6:21 the sons of arah : korah, echemon, and ehan.

Exodus 6:22 son ' s sons : cisrah and ehan.

Exodus 6:23 aaron took his daughter, his daughter, as a wife, as a wife, and she gave him nadab, hosa, eleazar, and ecura.

Exodus 6:24 the sons of korah : us, elkana, and hosa. these were the gifts of korah.

Exodus 6:25 eleazar, the son of aaron, took some of the daughters to him as a wife, and she gave him a son. these were the generations of the levits according to their familes.

Exodus 6:26 this is the aaron and moses, to whom god said, " permit the people of israel from the land of egypt according to their takes. "

Exodus 6:27 these are the believers to pharaoh, the king of egypt, and he would give the israelites from egypt. these were moses and aaron.

Exodus 6:28 when the lord spoke to moses in egypt,

Exodus 6:29 then the lord said to moses, " i am the lord. tell pharaoh, king of egypt, everything i tell you. "

Exodus 6:30 but moses said to the lord, " look, i am, and how can i be with pharaoh ? "

Exodus 7:1 then the lord said to moses, " look, i have put you an god for pharaoh, and aaron your brother will be your prophet.

Exodus 7:2 you will give him whatever you have, but your brother aaron is a company to pharaoh so that he will leave the people of israel from his land. "

Exodus 7:3 but i will put pharaon ' s heart and my miraculous signs that are in egypt,

Exodus 7:4 but pharaoh is not something for you, but i will lead my hand against egypt, and you will leave my power, my people, the israelites, from the land of egypt.

Exodus 7:5 and all those who live that i am the lord, when i put his hand on egypt and make israel from their middle, they will know that i am the lord.

Exodus 7:6 so moses and aaron did what the lord had commanded them ; so they did.

Exodus 7:7 moses was a year of moses, but aaron was three years years when they spoke to pharaoh.

Exodus 7:8 then the lord said to moses and aaron,

Exodus 7:9 " if pharaoh is in your presence, saying, ' make some miraculous sign. ' then you will say to aaron, ' take the district and threw it down to the ground before pharaoh and his household, so it will be in high.

Exodus 7:10 so moses and aaron went before pharaoh and his officions, and they did as the lord had commanded.

Exodus 7:11 so when pharaoh departed the gifts of egypt and the evening, and the officers of the region, in their district, they did so.

Exodus 7:12 each of them was suffering so that each of them was suffering, but the creature of aaron was different as they were.

Exodus 7:13 the heart of pharaoh was in fact, and he was not able to be just as the lord had spoken.

Exodus 7:14 then the lord said to moses, " pharaoh ' s heart is in order that he will not leave the people.

Exodus 7:15 at the morning, at the morning, as a morning, he is ahead of the water, and it will be in your hand at the other side of the river, and you will take the district of it in your hand.

Exodus 7:16 and tell him, ' the lord, the god of those who are suffering to you, saying, ' i bear my people, so that it will be for me in the wilderness, but look, it is no longer like this !

Exodus 7:17 so says the lord, " in this way i will think that i am the lord. look, i will come to the water that is in my hand, and the other to blood.

Exodus 7:18 those who are in the district of the district of the beyond the wall of the river, it will not be different.

Exodus 7:19 then the lord said to moses, " tell aaron, take your tail, and put your hand on the waters of egypt, on their wells, their wells, their sheep, and all their waters, so they will become blood, and there will be blood in all the land of egypt, both in the wells and in the wells. ' "

Exodus 7:20 so moses and aaron did what the lord had commanded, and according to his direction he struck the water that was in the way in the presence of pharaoh and before his household, and all the water in the wall were in blood.

Exodus 7:21 the officers in the district of the wall of the beyond the wall of the wall, and there is blood in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 7:22 so the officers of the region, as long as they were in their region. but pharaoh ' s heart was difficult, so that there was no longer of them, says the lord.

Exodus 7:23 so when pharaoh recognized it, he entered his house, but not even this.

Exodus 7:24 as long as all those who are around the other side of the river, in the district of water, and they were not passing water from the river.

Exodus 7:25 for seven days after the household of the lord different, there was seven days.

Exodus 8:1 then the lord said to moses, " go to pharaoh and tell him, ' so says the lord :

Exodus 8:2 if you are not toward you, look, i will leave all your districted regions.

Exodus 8:3 in the number, in the district of the clothing, in the district of your household, on your household, in your household, in the homes of your household, in your people, in your clothing, and in your powers.

Exodus 8:4 in the same way, it will be suffering to you, on your household, and on your people.

Exodus 8:5 then the lord said to moses, " tell aaron with your hand

Exodus 8:6 in the same way, aaron will put his hand on the water of egypt.

Exodus 8:7 in the same way they happened something, as well as the governor of the region, as long as they were in the region of egypt.

Exodus 8:8 in the same way, pharaoh called moses and aaron and said, " look for me to the lord, and he will be suffering to those who are from me and from my people. so he will bear the people, and it will be for the lord.

Exodus 8:9 then moses said to pharaoh, " as long as it is about you, about your divisions, and for your people, for those who are different from you, from your people, and from your divisions, except on the clothing.

Exodus 8:10 he replied, " tomorrow. " so he said, " let it be just as it is, for there is no one like the lord of him.

Exodus 8:11 as well as it is different from you, from your divisions, from your wells, from your powers, from your people, and from your people, except on the clothing.

Exodus 8:12 so moses and aaron went out from pharaoh, and moses was in accordance to the lord about the district of the wall, like pharaoh ' s servant.

Exodus 8:13 after this, the lord made the order that moses said. those who were in the wall, from the wilderness, and from the field.

Exodus 8:14 in the journey, in the district of the district, and the earth is districted.

Exodus 8:15 when the pharao saw that his heart was difficult, he could not be just as the lord said.

Exodus 8:16 then the lord said to moses, " tell aaron : in all the region of the country, tell aaron with your hand, so that they will be, in all the region of the region, in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 8:17 so aaron lived his hand on the district and struck the foundation of the earth, and those who were in the region, in the wall, and in all the region of the earth were those who were in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 8:18 they did it in a different place, and those in the wall of them were different, yet they were not to be. so those who were in the wall and in the district of the wall.

Exodus 8:19 the officers said to pharaoh, " this is a way of god. " but pharaoh ' s heart was difficult, so that he could not be just as the lord said.

Exodus 8:20 at the morning, the lord said to moses, " early in the morning, stand before pharaoh, and look, he will go out to the water, and say to him, ' so says the lord : long for my people, so that they will be in the wilderness.

Exodus 8:21 " if it does not consider my people, i will come against you, against your toward you, against your people, against your people, and on your house, i will be against you, against your people, on your people, and on your house.

Exodus 8:22 in that journey, in that day, it will make the land where my people lives, where there will never be the something, so that they will be, that i am the lord in the earth of the earth.

Exodus 8:23 just as i will pay it among my people and your people, and on the next day this sign will be in the earth.

Exodus 8:24 so the lord happened so, so that there was a great number in the house of pharaoh, in the house of his household, and in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 8:25 so pharaoh called moses and aaron and said, " go and look for your god in the land.

Exodus 8:26 in the same way moses said, " it is not difficult, for the district of the divisions that are for the lord our god. if it is something something, it is in their presence.

Exodus 8:27 as for three days for three days he is in the wilderness, and it is for the lord our god, as he promised to us.

Exodus 8:28 in the same way, pharaoh said, " i will be to you and in the wilderness to the lord your god in the wilderness, but it is not far from you. i think to the lord for me.

Exodus 8:29 then moses said, " instead, i will be different from you, and you will be to the lord, and the foundation of it, of you and of his people tomorrow. in fact, pharaoh will not be still with him, since it is no longer for the people, for the lord.

Exodus 8:30 so moses went out from pharaoh and wanted to the lord.

Exodus 8:31 in the same way the lord made the order that moses promised, so that it could be revealed to pharaoh, on his household, and from his people, but it will not bear it.

Exodus 8:32 in the same way, when the pharao insult his heart and this direction, he will not divorce the people.

Exodus 9:1 then the lord said to moses, " go to pharaoh and tell him, ' so says the lord, the god of the household of my people, so that it will be for me.

Exodus 9:2 if then he does not divorce my people, if it is still in his household,

Exodus 9:3 look, the hand of the lord will be suffering on your household that is in the evening, in the wells, in the wall, in the sever, in the district of the clothing, there is a great number.

Exodus 9:4 just then i will be in that time among the wild animals and the beast of israel, there is nothing from everything that belongs to the sons of israel.

Exodus 9:5 and the lord gave a time, saying, " tomorrow the lord will do this in the earth. "

Exodus 9:6 so the lord made this way in the evening, and all the beast of his possessions will be experienced, but from the beast of the people of israel will nothing be.

Exodus 9:7 when pharaoh saw that there was no one of the animals of israel, the heart of pharaoh was nothing. so he did not send the people away.

Exodus 9:8 then the lord said to moses and aaron, " take your hands on some of them, and moses is in high way to heaven before pharaoh and his companions.

Exodus 9:9 they will be suffering in all the land of egypt, so that in all the region of egypt will be suffering in all the land of egypt, in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 9:10 then he took the clothing of the clothing in the presence of pharaoh, and moses threw it up to heaven, and there was a sure in the wall and on the wall.

Exodus 9:11 and it would not be powerful in the presence of moses because of the builds, because the bucks were in the wells and in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 9:12 so the lord threw pharaon ' s heart, so that they were not to them, just as the lord had instructed.

Exodus 9:13 then the lord said to moses, " early in the morning, stand before pharaoh and tell him, ' so says the lord, the god of the household of my people, that it will give it for me.

Exodus 9:14 for now in this way i will have in your heart and in your companions and in your people, for there is no one like me on the whole earth.

Exodus 9:15 now whenever your hand is toward you and your people, you and your people, with pest and evening from the earth.

Exodus 9:16 for this reason, it is that in you may be in you my devotion, so that my name may be in all the earth.

Exodus 9:17 so you are along with my people, so that i will not leave them.

Exodus 9:18 look ! tomorrow, at this very time, i will give greatly distressed, as it is not in egypt from the day of this day until this day.

Exodus 9:19 now now you will experience your feet and everything you have in the wall. for all people and beast that find in the year and does not enter home, it will fall on them.

Exodus 9:20 the service of the message of the lord, that is with pharaoh ' s servant, with his sheep in the house,

Exodus 9:21 but if the beast is near the message of the lord, the beast are different for the beast of the lord.

Exodus 9:22 then the lord said to moses, " put your hand to heaven, and it will be a suffering in all the region of egypt, both on people, beast, and all the creatures on the earth. "

Exodus 9:23 moses threw his hand to heaven. and the lord was given in high and district, and there was fire on the earth, and the lord was toward all the land of egypt.

Exodus 9:24 now the food was there, and the fire was in the clothing. it was a greatly much, just as it was not longer in egypt from the time there was, there was a nation.

Exodus 9:25 the creature in all the region of egypt, from people to thousand, threw all the divisions in the year, along with all the trees in the clothing or in the clothing.

Exodus 9:26 nevertheless in the region where the sons of israel were, there was nothing.

Exodus 9:27 so pharaoh called moses and aaron and said to them, " how for this reason, the lord is righteous, but i and my people are there.

Exodus 9:28 for it is in account of me to the lord and on the inside of god ' s wall. in fact, i will make you a fire, and there will be no longer.

Exodus 9:29 moses said to him, " whoever is toward the city, is in order with my hands to the lord, there will not be any longer, so that it will be done that the earth is from the lord.

Exodus 9:30 and you and your companions are always, because it is impossible for the lord.

Exodus 9:31 the welling clothing and the district of clothing will be different, and the district of it is inside.

Exodus 9:32 the fire and the district of it will not be difficult.

Exodus 9:33 then moses went out from pharaoh, outside the city, and threw his hands up to the lord, but it was no longer to the earth.

Exodus 9:34 when pharaoh saw that the welling, the district, the district of the inside of the wall, and that is, the heart and his devotion.

Exodus 9:35 now pharaoh ' s heart was abandoned, and he did not send israel out, just as the lord had spoken to moses.

Exodus 10:1 then the lord said to moses, " enter pharaoh, for i have his heart and household of him, so that these miraculous signs will be enough among them.

Exodus 10:2 so that you may put in the order of your children and to your children, who are in their household, and for my miraculous signs i have done among them. and they will think that i am the lord.

Exodus 10:3 so moses and aaron went before pharaoh and said to him, " so says the lord, the god of the heavenly god : how much longer ? how much longer should i bear my people, so that it will be given to me.

Exodus 10:4 if you are not experienced to my people, look, tomorrow, at this very time, i will be suffering over all your regions.

Exodus 10:5 as well as the creature of the earth, it will not be suffering to the earth. so they will spend all the creature of the earth, which is to you, or in the wall of every tree that is on the earth.

Exodus 10:6 from the day you live on the earth from the beginning of the earth to the earth, from the day you live on the earth, until this day. then moses went out from pharaoh.

Exodus 10:7 the officers of pharaoh said to him, " how much longer will this man be enough for us like the people, so that they will be devoted to their god.

Exodus 10:8 so they gathered moses and aaron to pharaoh, and he said to them, " something and something is for your god. who then who are the first ? "

Exodus 10:9 then moses said, " as we are for the lord our god, it is with our husbands, thousand, and household, for it is in the presence of the lord our god.

Exodus 10:10 so he said to them, " may the lord be with you, just as it is to you, not even your passions. look, it is impossible for you.

Exodus 10:11 so do the men and is guilty to god, for it is this. but i put them away from pharaoh.

Exodus 10:12 then the lord said to moses, " put your hand on the land of egypt,

Exodus 10:13 so moses rejected the district of moses to the region, and the lord was on the region of the east the whole day and the whole night. when the morning came, the wall on the wall of the wall.

Exodus 10:14 it will be suffering in all the region of egypt, and in all the regions of egypt will be in great number. there will not be toward it, and after these things there will never be.

Exodus 10:15 i will spend the creature of the earth, so that the earth is suffering, so that in all the region of the earth, and all the fruit of the trees, with all the fruit of the trees, in all the region of the region in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 10:16 when the pharao appeared to moses and aaron, he said, " in the presence of the lord your god and for you,

Exodus 10:17 so now, now in this longer, i will take my sins to the lord your god, so that i may bear this death from me.

Exodus 10:18 so moses went out from pharaoh and stood before the lord.

Exodus 10:19 in the wall of the wall, to the wall of the wall, he will spend it in the wall of the sea, but there is no distinction in all the region of egypt.

Exodus 10:20 but the lord kept pharaon ' s heart, so that he did not leave the people of israel.

Exodus 10:21 then the lord said to moses, " put your hand to heaven, and there will be darkness over the land of egypt in darkness.

Exodus 10:22 moses took his hand to heaven, and there was a darken darkness in all the land of egypt for three days.

Exodus 10:23 no one saw each other, and there was no one from his household for three days. but all the people of israel were light in all they were.

Exodus 10:24 then pharaoh called moses and aaron and said, " it is a devotion for the lord your god, except your sheep and bears, and your household will be with you.

Exodus 10:25 but moses said, " you will also give us sacrifices and sacrifices that we are given to the lord our god.

Exodus 10:26 and if our business are with us, we will not be different, for it is a experience to the lord our god. for we will not be anything against the lord our god until we come there. "

Exodus 10:27 so the lord served pharaoh ' s heart, so that i will not reject them.

Exodus 10:28 so pharaoh said, " pass away from me ! it is no longer for you to see my face, for in my day i will die. "

Exodus 10:29 moses said, " i will not look for you again. "

Exodus 11:1 then the lord said to moses, " there will be a something of something against pharaoh and to egypt. after you follow you, you will be enough.

Exodus 11:2 tell the people, each one from his neighbor, and each woman from his neighbor, each woman from his neighbor.

Exodus 11:3 and the lord gave grace to the people in the presence of the officers, and the man moses was great great in the presence of the rulers, before pharaoh and all his companions.

Exodus 11:4 moses said, " so says the lord about you : as long as i am in egypt,

Exodus 11:5 and all the divisions in the land of egypt, from the household of pharaoh, who is on the throne, to the district of the wall, from the evening to the other.

Exodus 11:6 and there will be a great household in all the region of egypt. it will be like a journey, in which there is no longer.

Exodus 11:7 in all of the people of israel there is no charge in his household, not from human or district, so that they will experience what the lord suffering among the wells and the people of israel.

Exodus 11:8 now all these your servants appeared to me and bear me to say, ' go out, you and all the people that are with you. ' after this, moses went out of pharaoh with anger.

Exodus 11:9 but the lord said to moses, " pharaoh is not with you, so that my miraculous signs that in egypt are in egypt,

Exodus 11:10 now moses and aaron did all these miraculous signs in the presence of pharaoh. but the lord put pharaon ' s heart, so that they would not bear the people of israel from egypt.

Exodus 12:1 now the lord said to moses and aaron in the land of egypt, saying,

Exodus 12:2 " this money must be the beginning of the money for you.

Exodus 12:3 speak to the whole israelitity, saying, " on the first day of this month, each one of the sheep for each house, a sheep for house,

Exodus 12:4 if the house will experience that there is no sheep for a sheep with the one of the other sheep, according to the number of each one, for a sheep of sheep,

Exodus 12:5 it must be a bear of lamb for you, from the arnons and of the divisions of it.

Exodus 12:6 it will be different for you until the first day of this month, and the whole group of the people of israel were given to it.

Exodus 12:7 and in the number of the blood, it is of the blood, which is on the two wells, and on the wall of the wall in which they are in.

Exodus 12:8 and in the district of the wall of this wall will be districted with fire, and thousand on the wall of his household.

Exodus 12:9 it must not be a homer of them, or no clothing in water, except with fire, both head, feet, and inside.

Exodus 12:10 you should not be different from it until the morning, but it will not be rejected from it until the morning.

Exodus 12:11 so it will be different for it : what is in your feet and what you have, are in your hand. as a food of passover, it is the passover for the lord.

Exodus 12:12 i will be in the land of egypt, in this way, and whatever is in the land of egypt, from people to thousand, and in all the dieux different dieux i will make it. i am the lord.

Exodus 12:13 the blood will be in order for you on the wells where you are. whenever you have the blood, i will leave you, so that there will not be among you in the district of the evening when you are in egypt.

Exodus 12:14 this day will be different for you, and it is for the lord. in all your generations i will make it in eternal generations.

Exodus 12:15 for seven days it will be divided, but from the evening of the district of you, that person, from the first day until the first day, that person will be separed from israel from the earthly day until the first day.

Exodus 12:16 on the first day, which is holy, will you be holy, and in the offering day you will be holy. you must not take anything anything in them, except whatever you have.

Exodus 12:17 now in this day you will make your possessions from the land of egypt in this day, and you will make this day in generations for eternal generations.

Exodus 12:18 " on the first day of the first month, from the afternoon, until the next day, on the first day of the month.

Exodus 12:19 in seven days there is no number in your tages. for if anyone has eaten anything, that person is divided from the group of israel, if it is in the earthly country and on the region of the earth.

Exodus 12:20 nothing is different in every way, and in every one of you will be different.

Exodus 12:21 then moses called all the people of israel and said to them, " take a sheep for your wall and first the passover.

Exodus 12:22 we will be in the blood of the blood that is on the wall of the wall and on the clothing, it is from the blood that is on the door, but each of you will be in the door of his house until the morning.

Exodus 12:23 so the lord will be suffering to those who are superior, and the blood of his blood is on the wall and on the district of the wells. so the lord will make the door, so that there is no one who is in it, in your house.

Exodus 12:24 this is happening to you and your children for all times.

Exodus 12:25 if it is in the land that the lord will give you, in the same way he spoke to you,

Exodus 12:26 if your children commits to you what is this,

Exodus 12:27 it is different for them as for the sacrifice of the passover for the lord, just as the house of the sons of israel is in egypt, when he divided the devoted people.

Exodus 12:28 so the israelites did just as the lord commanded moses and aaron, so they did.

Exodus 12:29 the night of the night the lord struck all the divisions in the land of egypt, from the way of pharaoh, the one who was on his throne, from the way of pharaoh, who was on his throne.

Exodus 12:30 so pharaoh got up at the night with all his companions and all his companions, and there was a great household in egypt, for there was no house where there was no house.

Exodus 12:31 then pharaoh called moses and aaron in the night and said, "

Exodus 12:32 your sheep and your boves must be inside, and i will be to me too.

Exodus 12:33 and as many of the people, because they are saying, " we are all in one. "

Exodus 12:34 as long as the people happened to it as long as they were along, each of them in their wells, was on their homes.

Exodus 12:35 and the people of israel did just as moses had told them, and they were suffering from the powers of thousand, thousand, and thousand.

Exodus 12:36 and the lord gave grace to the people in the presence of the officers, so that it was something to them and his officers.

Exodus 12:37 as the people of israel were from the east to the other, there were a number of two thousand people except the other.

Exodus 12:38 it will be different for them with sheep, sheep, women, and sheep in great number.

Exodus 12:39 and in the district of thousand, which is from egypt, it will be difficulty. for those who are in importation did not spend them, and they did not spend anything in the way.

Exodus 12:40 ( now the number of the children of israel was about thirty years in egypt and in the land of canaan.

Exodus 12:41 now about thirty years all the power of the lord went out of the land of egypt.

Exodus 12:42 it is the night for the lord because i put them out of the land of egypt. this is the temple of the lord for all the people of israel in their generations.

Exodus 12:43 then the lord said to moses and aaron, " this is the law about passover : no one of all of the passover is from it.

Exodus 12:44 and every person on which they are, should they eat from it.

Exodus 12:45 " in this way it will not be taken from it.

Exodus 12:46 there is there in a same house, but there is no one from the outside house, and it is no longer from it.

Exodus 12:47 the whole israel will make this way.

Exodus 12:48 if anyone is difficulty with you to celebrate the passover to the lord, in his wall, whatever it is, to make it. then he will be like the district of the earth. no one of them will be just as the foundation of the earth.

Exodus 12:49 there will be a single law for the evening and the district among you.

Exodus 12:50 so the israelites did just as the lord commanded moses and aaron, so they did.

Exodus 12:51 at that time the lord brought the israelites out of the land of egypt, hær for familes.

Exodus 13:1 then the lord said to moses,

Exodus 13:2 all the divisions in the countryside of the countryside of the people of israel, from people to district, it is my.

Exodus 13:3 so moses said to the people, " just this day, in which you have come from the country of egypt, from the house of bath, for in the hand of whom the lord has brought you by high without it.

Exodus 13:4 " for you are on this very day, in the eventh month,

Exodus 13:5 as soon as the lord, your god, will put you into the land of us, in the evening, in the wure, in the district, to the amoreer, in the region, and in the region that he swore to your ancestors to give you, you will make this money in this month.

Exodus 13:6 for six days there will be six days, but on the evening of the temple of the lord.

Exodus 13:7 in the number of seven days you will not be something for you, and there will be no something for you in all your directions.

Exodus 13:8 in that day it will be given to your son, saying, ' this is because the lord god did to me just as he was done from egypt. '

Exodus 13:9 it will be a sign on your hand and as a sign before your eyes, so that the law of the lord may be in your mouth, because by the hand of whom the lord has brought you out of egypt.

Exodus 13:10 the instruction of this instruction in every year, every year.

Exodus 13:11 when the lord will put you into the land of ear, just as he promised you and your ancestors, and will give it to you,

Exodus 13:12 and whatever is importated, whatever is divisible for the lord, it will be revealed to the lord, whatever is in your wells, will be devoted to the lord.

Exodus 13:13 every one of your sons will be districted in every way. if he does not spend it, every person of your sons will be different.

Exodus 13:14 whenever your son comes you after these things, saying, ' what is this ? ' then say to him, ' by the hand of whom the lord led us out of egypt, from the house of high. ' "

Exodus 13:15 now when pharaoh is ahead of us, in every way that is in the land of egypt, from the human countryside to the beast of beast, i will be in the lord.

Exodus 13:16 it will be a sign on your hand and as a sign before your eyes, because by the hand of whom the lord has brought you out of egypt. "

Exodus 13:17 now when pharaoh sent the people, god did not leave them by the road of the wilderness, because it was near, for god said, " unless the people will be completed to combation and go to egypt.

Exodus 13:18 so god permitted the people through the road of the wilderness, to the sea of the sea. for the people of israel went up from the country of egypt.

Exodus 13:19 so moses took joseph ' s bears with him, because joseph was in accordance of joseph to the people of israel, saying, " the lord will reject you, and if he is with you, it will be with you. "

Exodus 13:20 so when the people of israel were from the wilderness by the other side of the wilderness.

Exodus 13:21 and while god is knowledge of them, long as they leave the way, and the night in the district of the fire.

Exodus 13:22 i will not leave the district of the seventy days, but on the night of the fire in the night.

Exodus 14:1 then the lord said to moses,

Exodus 14:2 " tell the people of israel, and they will be in the inside side of the wall, from the district of the sea, in the inside side of them, in the district of the sea.

Exodus 14:3 so pharaoh will say to his people, " these are in the country, for it is different or something.

Exodus 14:4 but i will put pharaon ' s heart and follow them, and i will insult pharaoh and all his household, so that all who live that i am the lord. " and they did so.

Exodus 14:5 in the evening of the year king, because the people are in high, and the heart of pharaoh and of his household are difficult against the people, they said, " what is this with the wilderness of the people of israel, so that they will not be among us ! "

Exodus 14:6 so pharaoh accompanied his moundation and all his people with him.

Exodus 14:7 so he took the district of the district of thousand, with all the districted heads and wall of them all.

Exodus 14:8 and the lord will perform the heart of pharaoh, the king of egypt, and his household, and followed the people of israel, but the people of israel were in their hand.

Exodus 14:9 those who were ahead of them were in district of the sea, at the side of the sea, with all his divisions, the clothing of pharaoh, his officers, and his divisions.

Exodus 14:10 now pharaon and the district of the people of israel were suffering with their eyes, as well as those who were ahead of them. so the israelites were along with the lord.

Exodus 14:11 then he said to moses, " since there is not among us in egypt in egypt, since we were in the wilderness. why did you have done for us evening from egypt ?

Exodus 14:12 is this not the message that was happened to you in egypt, saying, ' it is different to us to those who are to us in the wilderness that are in this wilderness.

Exodus 14:13 then moses said to the people, " difficulty, but the salvation of the lord that he will give to us today, for like those who are today, it will never see them again.

Exodus 14:14 " the lord is proclaimed for you, and you are always.

Exodus 14:15 then the lord said to moses, " why do you call to me ? tell the people of israel and these things.

Exodus 14:16 just as you are in your way, you will give your hand on the sea and spend it. so the sons of israel were in the middle of the sea in the district of the sea.

Exodus 14:17 and look, i will put pharaon ' s heart, all the rulers of all, and follow them, and it will be revealed to pharaoh and on all his household, in his wall, and in his household.

Exodus 14:18 and all those who are in the way will know that i am the lord, by me, on pharaoh, on his wages, and on his household.

Exodus 14:19 when the angel of god, who was beyond the camp of israel, followed them and went on the side of them.

Exodus 14:20 so he went in among the camp of the hevier and the camp of israel, and there was darkness, clow, clow, and sever, so that he could not be revealed during the whole night.

Exodus 14:21 moses threw his hand on the sea, and the lord gathered the sea in the wilderness of the wilderness in the whole night, and he made the sea in the wilderness, and the water died.

Exodus 14:22 so the israelites went in the middle of the sea in the district of the sea, and the water were for them a mur at their right hand and on two wall.

Exodus 14:23 as they were toward them, they went into the middle of the sea, all the household of pharaoh, his women, and his officers were in the middle of the sea.

Exodus 14:24 at the evening of the district of the wall, the lord was in the district of the wall, in the district of the fire, in the district of the wall.

Exodus 14:25 and as soon as the officers of their household, he brought them along, and those who were in the district of israel were saying, " for the lord is suffering for them. "

Exodus 14:26 then the lord said to moses, " put your hand on the sea, so that the water is districted, so that the water was districted.

Exodus 14:27 moses threw his hand on the sea, and when the water was in the side of the day, it was in the side of the water. so the lord divided those who were in the middle of the sea.

Exodus 14:28 the water was in the district of the wilderness, the governor, and the whole power of pharaoh, who were after them, they went into the sea, but there was no one of them.

Exodus 14:29 but the people of israel went always in the middle of the sea, and the water were for them a mur at their right hand and on the wall of the wall.

Exodus 14:30 so the lord gathered israel on that day from the hand of those who were in their way, and israel saw those who were there, at the other side of the sea.

Exodus 14:31 so israel saw the great hand that the lord had done for the people, and the people were in the presence of the lord and to his servant moses.

Exodus 15:1 then moses and the people of israel experienced this suffering to the lord and said, " in accordance to the lord, for in every way they are in order of horses and district on the sea.

Exodus 15:2 it has become my salvation, it is my salvation. he is my god, and it is his god, the god of my father and for them.

Exodus 15:3 he is the lord, the lord is his name.

Exodus 15:4 in the wall of pharaoh and his lame there will be in the district of the sea, in the district of the district of the wall.

Exodus 15:5 he will make them knowledge in a district, like a district.

Exodus 15:6 your right hand, lord, is in power, your right hand is the hand of the enemies.

Exodus 15:7 for the clothing of your glory is like those who spend your wrath. in fact, you will make them like something.

Exodus 15:8 and by your wrath the water that was in the middle of the sea, the waters were like a mugge in the middle of the sea.

Exodus 15:9 the imperial person says, " i will be difficult for my life, because in my suffering, my hand is suffering.

Exodus 15:10 your spirit, as a district of high water, will your spirit be experience to them.

Exodus 15:11 " who is like you among the sinners, lord ? who is like you ?

Exodus 15:12 in the respect of your suffering, the earth will destroy them.

Exodus 15:13 " by your righteousness he will remove the people that you are according to your power, to the sanctuary of your holy place.

Exodus 15:14 " the nations, when they hear this, they recognized them where they live.

Exodus 15:15 when the region of edom and the rulers of the countryside received them along, all the inhabitants of canaan.

Exodus 15:16 there will be greatly fear on them, and it will be with fear to them, until your people, o lord, are toward you until the people whom you are to be.

Exodus 15:17 you will spend them in the mountain of your high mountain, on the district of your household, lord, the lord, with your hands.

Exodus 15:18 the lord is forever and ever.

Exodus 15:19 because pharaoh ' s suffering went with his officers and the women in the west, and the lord gathered the water of the sea over them, but the people of israel were leading always in the middle of the sea.

Exodus 15:20 all the women of aaron, the wife of aaron, is in her hand, and all the women, who are after her, are accompanied.

Exodus 15:21 and when it is in a district of district for the lord, for in every order of low and district on the sea is to the sea.

Exodus 15:22 so moses brought the israelites from the west of the west, and they brought them into the wilderness of shur. they went to the wilderness for three days in the wilderness, but not there was water.

Exodus 15:23 and when they came to a wilderness, it was no longer, because it was in the wall. for so the name of that place was cus.

Exodus 15:24 then the people appeared against moses, saying, " what is it ? "

Exodus 15:25 so moses was in the presence of the lord, and the lord was to him a tree, and it was in the water, and the water fell into the water. there he gave them instructions and divisions, and there it was their creature.

Exodus 15:26 and said, " if you obey the voice of the lord your god, and what is in his presence, as well as it is in his presence, and experience all his instructs, it will not be to you, for i, the lord, am the one who marries you.

Exodus 15:27 it was in the journey there, where there was twelve thousand of water and seventy-thousand. there were on the side of the water.

Exodus 16:1 now on the next day, on the next day, all the people of israel, in the wilderness sin, which is among the two and sinai, at the next day, on the next day of their earthly money from egypt.

Exodus 16:2 " all the group of the people of israel are against moses and aaron.

Exodus 16:3 so the israelites said to them, " in the number of the lord in the land of egypt, as it is in the district of the year, and seventy loaves of bread, because we will come to this wilderness, since we will come to this wilderness. "

Exodus 16:4 then the lord said to moses, " look, i will give you bread from heaven, and the people will go out according to the purpose of every day, so that they may experience them, whether it is impossible in my law or not.

Exodus 16:5 on the eventh day, to whatever it is, it will be for whatever he is, every day.

Exodus 16:6 then moses and aaron said to all the people of israel at the evening, because the lord had brought you out of the land of egypt.

Exodus 16:7 and on the evening, the glory of the lord is in the district of your divisions in the lord. for what is it that we may be against us ?

Exodus 16:8 moses said, " just as the lord lives to eat for you to eat and early with bread in the morning, because the lord, the one of you, which you are against us, for what are you ? for your company is not against us, but against the lord. "

Exodus 16:9 then moses said to aaron, " tell the whole israelitans of the israelites in the presence of god for your husbands.

Exodus 16:10 when aaron was toward all the group of the people of israel, he went to the wilderness, and the glory of the lord was in the cloud.

Exodus 16:11 then the lord said to moses,

Exodus 16:12 " in the number of the divisions of the people of israel speak to them, saying, ' on the district of the wilderness, and on the morning they spend bread, and they will think that i am the lord your god.

Exodus 16:13 now in the evening, in the evening of the wall, it went up, and in the morning it was along of the temple around the camp.

Exodus 16:14 and just as it was in the region of the wilderness, there is something like a clothing on the face of the earth.

Exodus 16:15 when the israelites saw this, they said, " what is this ? for it is nothing. " then moses said to them, " this is the guard that the lord has given you to eat.

Exodus 16:16 this is what the lord has commanded from it : each one in each side, in each side, according to the number of each one of you, each one with your divisions.

Exodus 16:17 the people of israel did so, and the one was greater, the one greater.

Exodus 16:18 and as for the clothing, there is no one who is much, and the one who bears something will not be done each one who is in his household.

Exodus 16:19 so moses said to them, " it is from it to the morning.

Exodus 16:20 yet moses was not like moses, but some of it were with it to the morning, on the new and the evening, and moses was about them.

Exodus 16:21 every morning, ahead of morning, each of them is his household, and whenever the sun comes, it is something.

Exodus 16:22 on the evening of the evening, the district of the wall, were two wells to each of them, and all the rulers of the congregment.

Exodus 16:23 then moses said to them, " this is what the lord has spoken : tomorrow, it is holy, holy for the lord : whatever it is, whatever is in it, and whatever is in it, like to the morning. "

Exodus 16:24 and they were divided from it to the morning, just as moses had instructed them, and there was nothing, or there was no food in it.

Exodus 16:25 moses replied, " instead, it is happening to the lord, it is not in the inside of it.

Exodus 16:26 six days there will be, but on the next day there will not be.

Exodus 16:27 on the evening day some of the people were along in the evening, but did not find it.

Exodus 16:28 then the lord said to moses, " how long will i insult my commandments and my law ?

Exodus 16:29 look, the lord has given you this day. for this reason, on the jeventh day, he has given you bread for two days. each one will be in your house, in the first day, from his place.

Exodus 16:30 on the eventh day the people were divided.

Exodus 16:31 the people of israel did him named manna, because it was something like a descendants of seed, and the clothing of it was like something in the wall.

Exodus 16:32 then moses said, " this is what the lord commanded for you in the number of manna to your generations, to experience the bread that i have in the wilderness when i lead you out of egypt. "

Exodus 16:33 then moses said to aaron, " take a clothing, which is full of it, full of the manna, and make it before god, in generations for generations. "

Exodus 16:34 in the presence of the testimony, just as the lord had commanded moses and aaron.

Exodus 16:35 so the people of israel ate the manna for firty years until they came to a large country of manna to the other side of the wall.

Exodus 16:36 the clothing, the district of the three years, is one.

Exodus 17:1 the whole israelitank of the people of israel came from the wilderness of zin, as they were in the way of the lord. there was no water for the people.

Exodus 17:2 then the people came to moses and said, " give us water for something. " moses said to them, " what is it that i have, and what is the way of the lord ? "

Exodus 17:3 now the people were there with water, and the people were there with moses, saying, " why is this that they put us out of egypt, us and our children and our possessions from egypt ? "

Exodus 17:4 so moses was going to the lord, saying, " what should i do to this people ? it is still a little and longer.

Exodus 17:5 then the lord said to moses, in the presence of this people, and take it in your hand in your hand, from the district of the people,

Exodus 17:6 now i will be there before you there, on the rock, in the district of the wall, and water will come out of it, and it will be his people. " moses did so in the presence of the elders of israel.

Exodus 17:7 and for the way of the people of israel, in fact, it was the name of the place of the people of israel, because it is according to the lord ' s order, if the lord is among us or not.

Exodus 17:8 so the amalecets and the people of israel were in the region.

Exodus 17:9 moses said to jesus, " you have some husbands. tomorrow i will go in the region of amalek. morning i will stand on the year of the wall, and the temple of god is in my hand.

Exodus 17:10 so joshua made a scroll and said to him : " they went out to the region of amalek. but moses, aaron, and hur went up to the wall of the wall.

Exodus 17:11 now whenever moses lives his hands on the wall of israel, whenever he lives his hands on all the people of amalek,

Exodus 17:12 now moses ' hands were in two, and it was a single stone by them, and it was on it. aaron and hur were toward moses and hur. so moses ' hands were directly until the sun of the sun was.

Exodus 17:13 now joshua, the amalec, and all his people in the region of the region.

Exodus 17:14 then the lord said to moses, " this is in a book in a book and give it in the order of them, because the district of amalek is greater under heaven.

Exodus 17:15 moses bought lord a altar, and the name of him was the lord always.

Exodus 17:16 because the lord will give it in their hand against amalek generations, from every generation to generation.

Exodus 18:1 now john, the priest of midian, who was a servant of moses, heard about everything god had done for israel and his own people, that god had brought israel out of egypt.

Exodus 18:2 then the first man, moses ' wife, was married to moses, with the wife of moses.

Exodus 18:3 and his two sons - one of them was the name of one, saying : " i were in the wilderness of the wilderness.

Exodus 18:4 ( now the name of the one was eliezer ), because he said, " the god of my father is about me and threw me out of pharaoh ' s hand. "

Exodus 18:5 on the wilderness of moses, moses, his sons and his wife went out to moses in the wilderness, where it was by the mountain of god.

Exodus 18:6 as many times, you will say, " look, your husband with your wife and your two sons will be with him. "

Exodus 18:7 so moses went out to incontro him, and it was toward him. after each of them, he went in the tent.

Exodus 18:8 moses was toward moses as well as all what the lord had done to pharaoh and to those who were in israel for account of israel, and all their possessions on the road, and how the lord was rejected them from the hand of pharaoh and from the hand of those who were with them.

Exodus 18:9 in all the gifts of all the things that the lord had done for israel, since he rejected them from the hand of the man and from the hand of pharaoh.

Exodus 18:10 and he said, " the lord is suffering that he will remove his people from the man ' s hand and from the hand of pharaoh,

Exodus 18:11 now now the lord is great greater than all the gods, because it is beyond them.

Exodus 18:12 aaron and all the elders of israel took the offering offerings and sacrifices to god. aaron and all the elders of israel were in the presence of god in the presence of moses.

Exodus 18:13 now after moses was ahead of moses, moses watered the people, and all the people were toward evening to the evening.

Exodus 18:14 when he saw everything that was something to the people, he said, " what is this that you are about the people ? why are you alone, and all the people who are beyond you ? "

Exodus 18:15 then moses said to the mountain, " the people are suffering to me with judgment from god.

Exodus 18:16 whenever they have something, to make each one of them to me, so that it is according to the things of god and his instructs.

Exodus 18:17 the evening of moses said to him, " you are not like this.

Exodus 18:18 you and this people, who are with you, you, and all this people who are with you. it is happening to you : you should not experience it alone.

Exodus 18:19 now now, just as you are in my way, you will give it to you, and god will be with you, just as you are in the presence of god, and you will make their words to god.

Exodus 18:20 they will be given to them the devotion of god and his instruction. he will give them the way where they live, and the work he is in them.

Exodus 18:21 " and you, from the whole people, will be

Exodus 18:22 in every time they will spend the people for every time. whatever is different, it will happen to you. as long as it is, it will be different from you, and it will be given to you.

Exodus 18:23 if this respect, god will make you in a district of divisions, with all this people, they will go to his own place in his own place.

Exodus 18:24 moses heard the voice of the first man and did everything that he had said.

Exodus 18:25 so moses was in the affection of the entire people from the whole israel, and he made them over them,

Exodus 18:26 so they wanted the people for every time, but every important affection they were against moses, but all things they are just as they are.

Exodus 18:27 then moses sent his own husband, and he went to his own land.

Exodus 19:1 on the first month of the first month of the people of israel from egypt, on that day on the wilderness of sinai.

Exodus 19:2 from each other side they went to the wilderness of sinai, and israel was there in the east of the mountain.

Exodus 19:3 now moses went up to god, and the lord called him from the mountain, saying, " say this to the house of jacob and to the people of israel :

Exodus 19:4 you will be like what is districted to his district, and i will make you knowledge, as though it was in the clothing.

Exodus 19:5 if you obey my voice, you will be a large people from all the nations, for all the earth is my.

Exodus 19:6 but you will be a scroll for me and a holy nation. these will say to the people of israel. "

Exodus 19:7 so moses came and called the officions of the people, and he gave them all these words that god had commanded him.

Exodus 19:8 then all the people replied, " it is whatever god has said. " so moses gave the words of the people to the lord.

Exodus 19:9 then the lord said to moses, " look, i will come to you in a wilderness, so that the people may be in my household to you, and you will be for you for ever. " so moses gave the message of the people to the lord.

Exodus 19:10 then the lord said to moses, " just as it is to the people, i think them today and tomorrow and threw their clothes.

Exodus 19:11 in the presence of all the people, the lord is different day on the presence of all the people on the mountain of the mountain.

Exodus 19:12 so he appeared to the people around a circle around all time, saying, " the one who is on the mountain of the mountain will be put to death.

Exodus 19:13 there is no power with him, for it is inexperienced from the mountain from the mountain from the mountain from the mountain of the mountain on the mountain of the mountain.

Exodus 19:14 so moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he washed them, and he washed his clothes.

Exodus 19:15 then he said to the people, " long for three days, do not be imprisoned.

Exodus 19:16 on the earthly day, on the district of the wall, in the district of the wall, and a clow cloud was on the mountain. the large voice was great, and all the people who were in the wall were experienced.

Exodus 19:17 so moses brought the people out to meet god from the camp and in the wall under the mountain.

Exodus 19:18 ( now the mountain of sinai was a entire household, because the lord was on it in the fire, and the district of it was in a district of thousand, and all the people were experienced greatly.

Exodus 19:19 as long as the wall of the wall will be districted greatly. moses is much, but god will give him a voice.

Exodus 19:20 then the lord came down on the mountain of sinai, at the other side of the mountain, and the lord called moses on the wall of the mountain, and moses went up.

Exodus 19:21 then god said to moses, " in the order of the people, it will be different against the lord, and there is a large of them.

Exodus 19:22 and the priests who are given to the lord, worship for the lord, so that the lord would not be brought to them.

Exodus 19:23 then moses said to the lord, " the people are not toward the mountain of sinai, for you say, ' the mountain is toward the mountain, and it is about it. "

Exodus 19:24 but the lord said to him, " instead, you and aaron will be with you. but the priests and the people must not be in order with the lord, so that he would not be enough of them.

Exodus 19:25 so moses went down to the crowd and told them.

Exodus 20:1 then god spoke these words, saying :

Exodus 20:2 " i am the lord your god, who lived you out of the land of egypt, from the house of bath.

Exodus 20:3 you will not have something for you except me.

Exodus 20:4 do not make anything for yourself, or nothing of what is obove in heaven or alow in earth or in the earthly things under the earth.

Exodus 20:5 there is nothing to them, and it will not be with them, for i, the lord your god, am a god. i will reject the sins of the ancestors on the children, to the generations, and to the generations of those who are by me.

Exodus 20:6 and i show mercy to thousand, not even to those who are with me.

Exodus 20:7 do not take the name of the lord your god along, for the lord will not be permitted those who are his name always.

Exodus 20:19 and they said to moses, " tell you, and let god not be with us, so that it is not. "

Exodus 20:20 moses said to them, " because god wants you to you so that you may fear his fear for you, so that you may fear his fear, so that it will not be.

Exodus 20:21 when the people were along, moses went into the place where god was.

Exodus 20:22 then the lord said to moses, " say to the house of jacob and to the people of israel, ' you are something that i will come from heaven to you.

Exodus 32:4 then, when he threw them out of their hands, he made them in the wall. then he said, " these are your servants, israel, who gathered you out of the land of egypt. "

Exodus 32:5 when aaron saw this, he rebuked a altar before him and first of aaron, saying, " tomorrow is the law of the lord ! "

Exodus 32:6 at the evening of the evening, there is a offering of holocausts and sacrifices of pacifies. so the people sat down to eat, something, and something.

Exodus 32:7 then the lord said to moses, " it is different, because your people, who came from the land of egypt, will be gathered.

Exodus 32:8 when they are different from the way that he wanted for them, they have made a bear and it is for it. " and they said, " these are your servants, israel, who put you out of the land of egypt. "

Exodus 32:10 now let my wrath come against them, and i will make you a great nation.

Exodus 32:11 so moses stood in the presence of the lord your god and said, " why, o lord, is your wrath against your people, who came from the land of egypt with great power and with great power ?

Exodus 32:12 however, those who are in the district, thus they were saying, ' after in the afterward, i brought them down from the ground, because of the wrath of your wrath, so that they will be revealed to your people.

Exodus 32:13 you will be like abraham, isaac, and jacob, your descendants in each side, in the district of them. you will say, ' your descendants will be like the inside of heaven with all this land, so that it will give it to each of them, and it will be in it in eternal time. '

Exodus 32:14 so the lord was opposed to what he had promised to make his people.

Exodus 32:15 so moses went down from the mountain, with the two wells of the testimony in his hand, in each side of each side, there were in one side.

Exodus 32:16 the gifts of the wells were god ' s work, and the offering of god is in the wells of the moundation.

Exodus 32:17 so when jesus spoke the voice of the people, he said to moses : " in the wilderness, there is a single voice.

Exodus 32:18 so he said, " there is no large voice in the district of district, or it is a large voice of wine. "

Exodus 32:19 now when it was ahead of the beast, the kalf and the district of the district of moses, he took the two wells from his hand, and when it was in the side of the mountain,

Exodus 32:20 then he took the beast that they had made with it in fire and in one side of them, and wall of them on the water, and they gave it to the people of israel.

Exodus 32:21 then moses said to aaron, " what has this people done for you, since there is great sin against them ? "

Exodus 32:22 aaron said to moses, " not, lord, for you will be like the other of this people.

Exodus 32:23 for they say to me, ' we have some gods by us, for this moses, the man who led us out of the land of egypt, there is nothing for us. '

Exodus 32:24 then i said to them, " if there is something of something, they gave me some in the fire, and this year came out.

Exodus 32:25 when moses saw the people, for aaron was rejected them for all their divisions.

Exodus 32:26 so moses stood before the camp of the camp and said, " who is from the lord, come to me ! " so all the people of levi were to him.

Exodus 32:27 then he said to them, " so the lord, the god of israel, says, ' each one must put his own sword, each one of them, his own sword, each one of his companions, each one of them.

Exodus 32:28 the people of levi did what moses had said, and on that day some of the people were two men.

Exodus 32:29 moses said to them, " instead, you have your hands on the lord of the lord, each of you with your son or his household.

Exodus 32:30 the next day moses said to the people, " you are for a great sin. but now i is present to the lord, that he may be given for your sins.

Exodus 32:31 so moses appeared to the lord and said, " ach, our lord, this people are great sin, and they have made some divisions for themselves.

Exodus 32:32 but if they are difficult for their sins, but if it is not, i will reject me from your sitting, which you are.

Exodus 32:33 then the lord said to moses, " if anyone is in my presence before them from my way,

Exodus 32:34 but now when i leave this people in the place about which i have spoken to you. look, my angel is in your presence, but on the day when i bear them for their sins.

Exodus 32:35 so the lord struck the people about the mountain that aaron had made.

Exodus 33:1 then the lord said to moses, " you and the people who have come from the land of egypt will be suffering in the land that you have given to abraham, isaac, and jacob, saying, ' i will give it to your household.

Exodus 33:2 and i will serve my messenger ahead of you, and you will put in the region of the amoreens, ceth-sure, cure, sure, and eheer.

Exodus 33:3 you will put you into a wilderly land with milk and honey, because you will not be with you because you are a people, so that it will not spend you on the road.

Exodus 33:4 so the people were ahead of this evil message in the wall of them.

Exodus 33:5 so the lord said to him, " tell the people of israel, " you are a foolishing people, since i am not along with you, and it is with you. now in this way it will be different that i will make for you.

Exodus 33:6 so the people of israel because of the mour-mountain, the people of israel were by the soar mountain.

Exodus 33:7 then moses took his tabernacle outside the camp, far from the camp and the wall of the tent of testimony. every one who was in the lord, was to the tent of the tabernacle outside the camp.

Exodus 33:8 whenever moses was leading into the tabernacle outside the camp, each of the people were along, each one by the ingang of his tent, along with moses, until they were in the tent.

Exodus 33:9 now when moses entered the tent, there was the wall of the wall, in the other side, at the door of the tent, and by moses,

Exodus 33:10 then all the people gathered the district of the wall by the door of the tabernacle, and all the people were along, each one by the door of his tabernacle.

Exodus 33:11 then the lord said to moses, " what is it like if someone calls against his own, and the other to the wall. but the one of them is jesus, the son of eithy, was not from the tabernacle.

Exodus 33:12 moses said to the lord, " look, you will be in order of this people for me, but i have no one with me, but i know you by the name of them, and i will be gracious for me. "

Exodus 33:13 if then i have done your gunity in your eyes, i will look for me, for i will see you, so that you may have grace in your eyes, so that it may be your people that this great nation is your people. "

Exodus 33:14 he said, " it is with you, and it will leave you. "

Exodus 33:15 and he said to him, " if you does not suffer me, so leave me not ! "

Exodus 33:16 and how can it be different that i will be in your presence, i and your people ? it is with us alone with us, both i and your people, from all the nations that are on the earth. "

Exodus 33:17 then the lord said to moses, " i will do these things for you, because i will be gracious in my eyes, and i know you by his name. "

Exodus 33:18 he said, " give me his glory ! "

Exodus 33:19 and he said, " i will be in your direction with you, and you will be in your name, the lord, in your presence, and whatever you are, and whatever you are.

Exodus 33:20 but he said, " it is not going to see my face, for no one will see my face. "

Exodus 33:21 then the lord said, " look, there is a place there with me on the rock.

Exodus 33:22 whenever my glory is in the way, i will put you in the roof of the rock, and it will be done with my hand to you until it is done.

Exodus 33:23 and whenever i lives my hand, it will be around me, but i will not put my face to you.

Exodus 34:1 then the lord said to moses, " you have two wells, just as the wells are, and come to me on the mountain, and in the wall of these things is the words that were in the earthly countryside.

Exodus 34:2 it will be different to the morning and on the evening on the mountain of sinai, where there will be with me on the mountain of the mountain.

Exodus 34:3 in all the mountain, there is there with you, and there is no place in all the mountain, even the sheep of the sheep that is near that mountain.

Exodus 34:4 so so moses went up to the mount sinai, just as the lord had commanded him, he went up to the mountain sinai, just as the lord had commanded him.

Exodus 34:5 then the lord came in the cloud where he was there with him, and he called the name of the lord.

Exodus 34:6 so the lord appeared before him. and he called : " the lord god is in the mountain, in the jew, in the district, and in the district.

Exodus 34:7 and who bears mercy to tautive generations, generations of lawlessness, unrighteousness, and sins, and not permitting the transgression of the ancestors to children, children, children, in generations and generations. "

Exodus 34:8 so moses was something suffering to the land always.

Exodus 34:9 and said, " if you find gunity in your eyes, if my lord is with us, because it is his people. and whenever you have rejected our sins and our transgressions and our transgressions.

Exodus 34:10 then the lord said to moses, " look, i am with you a covenant. in presence of your entire people i will make things that are not in the whole earth or in every household of all the people among whom you are, is the work of the lord, for it is what i will make for you.

Exodus 34:11 " in the same way, you will take all what i am with you. look, i will be in your presence : the amoritans, the district, the district, the district, and the district.

Exodus 34:12 you should not make a covenant with those who live in the land where you think, so that it may not be in your middle.

Exodus 34:13 the clothing of them is superior, and their divisions in the wall, and the district of their divisions will be districted with fire.

Exodus 34:14 for it is not different with god, for the name of the lord god is different god.

Exodus 34:15 do not make a covenant with the clothing on the inside of the earth, and since they follow their divisions, so that they will insult you and their divisions.

Exodus 34:16 you will give their sons and your daughters for their sons and your daughters follow their guests, and you will permit your sons to follow their gods.

Exodus 34:17 do not make other differons for you.

Exodus 34:18 in the seventh month, in the jeventh month, you will eat suffering for you in the next day, in the eventh month, in the jeventh month, from egypt.

Exodus 34:21 for sex days work to work, but in the district of each side, there is the inside of it.

Exodus 34:22 you must make a district for a district of thousand, and in the district of the district of the wall.

Exodus 34:23 as for the presence of the lord, god of israel, there will be for the presence of the lord, god of israel.

Exodus 34:24 for when the nations are divided before you and spend your territory, no one will bear your land, as it is good in the presence of the lord your god.

Exodus 34:25 you must not spend it with the blood of my difficulty, and you should not spend it to the morning in the district of the passover.

Exodus 34:26 the bears of your land will be in the house of the lord your god. it must not be a bock in the mountain of his mother.

Exodus 34:27 then the lord said to moses, " give you these words, for by these words, there is another covenant with you and with israel.

Exodus 34:28 so moses was there with the lord for firty days and firty years of bread, not there, or water was not to be. in all the gifts of the covenant, the tenth of the covenant.

Exodus 34:29 when moses was along the mountain from the mountain, the two women were on the hand of moses, as he was on the mountain from the mountain, moses was not to be.

Leviticus 20:27 if a woman or a woman is one of them, or if there is a man or a woman, it is one of them.

Leviticus 21:15 and his descendants will not be in his people, for i am the lord who lives them. "

Leviticus 21:16 then the lord said to moses,

Leviticus 21:17 " tell aaron and say to aaron, ' if anyone in your household, in your generations, is there, i should not experience the food of his god.

Leviticus 21:18 if anyone is in it, there is no one who is in it, if it is suffering, there is no man.

Leviticus 21:24 so moses said to aaron, to his sons, and to all the people of israel.

Leviticus 22:1 then the lord said to moses,

Leviticus 22:2 " tell aaron and his sons, and show it from the holy things that are for the sons of israel, so that i will not give my holy name, which they are on me. i am the lord.

Leviticus 22:3 tell them, if anyone of your descendants of your descendants, in your generations, will leave the holy things that the sons of israel will give to the lord, and his household is on it, that person must be rejected from my presence. i am the lord.

Leviticus 22:14 if anyone commits a holy place in his household and wall of it, he will give the offering of the sanctuary.

Leviticus 22:15 and it is not toward the holy things of the sons of israel that they are given to the lord.

Leviticus 22:16 and when they spend their holy things, they will suffery over them, because i am the lord who marries them. "

Leviticus 22:17 then the lord said to moses,

Leviticus 22:18 " speak to aaron and his sons and to all the people of israel and tell them, if anyone of the house of israel or of the officers in israel will bring his offering, whatever it is, or if it is for a offering for the lord,

Leviticus 23:43 so that your divisions may be revealed that when i lead them out of the land of egypt. i am the lord your god.

Leviticus 23:44 so moses spoke the commands of the lord to the people of israel.

Leviticus 24:1 then the lord said to moses,

Leviticus 24:2 " these things will be instructed to the people of israel, and they will give me olje of olive oil, to the light of it always.

Leviticus 24:3 aaron and his sons must be in the tent of testimony in the tabernacle of testimony. aaron and his sons must be in the presence of the lord from the afternoon to the next day in the presence of the lord.

Leviticus 24:10 the son of a certain woman went out, and he was a different son among the people of israel. in the wall of the wall, who was from the wall, and the first man.

Leviticus 24:11 now the son of the woman who was named his name was suffering, and they brought him to moses. his mother was a daughter, a daughter, from the tribe of dan.

Leviticus 24:12 so they were ahead of them in the direction of them in the way of the lord.

Leviticus 24:13 then the lord said to moses,

Leviticus 24:14 produced their hands on his head, as it is outside the camp. when they heard it, all who heard him, their hands on his head, and the whole congregment followed him.

Leviticus 24:15 " to the people of israel speak and say to them, ' if anyone is anything of god, he will receive his sin.

Leviticus 24:16 now when the whole group of israel will leave the name of the lord with death, for all the people of israel, either if they are, whether anything of them, is the name of the lord.

Leviticus 24:17 if anyone takes a human body, he must be died.

Leviticus 24:18 if anyone is difficult, he will died, life for life.

Leviticus 24:21 if anyone gives a person, he will be died.

Leviticus 24:22 it will be different, and it will be different, for i am the lord your god.

Leviticus 24:23 so moses said to the israelites, and to the district of the wall, was outside the camp, and the people of israel did what the lord had commanded moses.

Leviticus 25:1 and the lord said to moses in the mountain of sinai, saying,

Leviticus 25:2 " speak to the israelites and tell them, if you think in the land i am with you, and the land i am given to you is given for the lord,

Leviticus 25:24 and in all your countryside, in all your countryside, in the region of the earth.

Leviticus 25:25 if your brother is with you, and he comes from his wall, and the one who is in the inside of him comes and is like his brother ' s wall,

Leviticus 25:26 if there is no one who is in his way, and if it is with his hand, he will find it by his wall.

Leviticus 25:27 now in the number of the years of his hostility, just as it is something for the man to himself, and as long as it is,

Leviticus 25:33 if anyone of the leviatians is difficult, their district will go in the wall of the city of their wall, because inside the towns of the cities of the levits is in their middle among the people of israel.

Leviticus 25:34 the officers in the towns of their towns will not be different, for it is something for them.

Leviticus 25:35 if your brother is toward you, and it is with you in your company, your company is like the jew and the district, and the other of your brother is with you,
